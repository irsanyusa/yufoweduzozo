Both fighters were unloading whopping lefts and straight rights as the final bell rang. But after 15 minutes of brawling, Lim’s hand was raised in a split decision victory.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ONE Fight Championship’s Total Domination event, held last October, was a disappointment for Osman, but “I definitely gave my best during the fight,” the Malaysian tells TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And despite her defeat, the bout captured the public’s imagination. On Mar. 14, following immense pressure from both fans and media, ONE FC, the largest MMA promotion in Asia, will host a rematch between Lim and Osman — only this time in Osman’s home country.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fight, which will be broadcast in 28 different countries, will contain several firsts. This will be Osman’s first fight in front of her fellow Malaysians, and it will be the first time a female Muslim fighter has competed on the global stage in a country where the official religion is Islam.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There’s an empowering element to women in Asia to see a strong, confident, fit female competing on a world scale, on a world stage, especially if you’re Muslim or if you’re from a Muslim country like Malaysia,” says ONE FC CEO Victor Cui.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not many sports give women similar prestige as their male counterparts, but the growing prominence of female UFC stars such as Ronda Rousey, Liz Carmouche and Misha Tate has almost given MMA that distinction. And with <a href=#>the meteoric rise of MMA in Asia</a>, ever more women are taking up the sport, and breaking fresh ground as they do.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Having a female fight in a Muslim country like Malaysia is going to be a first,” says Cui. “There’s a huge cultural implication.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Malaysia may not be Saudi Arabia or Iran, but religious conservatism is increasingly prevalent there. In October, the <a href=#>country’s courts</a> ruled that only Muslims have the legal right to use the word ‘Allah,’ sparking fierce protests from the nation’s Christian minority, who have longed used the same word for God.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nevertheless, Osman, 27, says she’s has never felt ostracized because of her gender or decision to push boundaries. “I’m fortunate to not have felt any of that pressure about me being Muslim and a female MMA fighter at the same time,” says the Sabah native. “I’m very fortunate to have the support from everyone I know.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to Malaysian MMA pioneer Melvin Yeoh, Osman’s acceptance comes from both ONE FC’s assertive marketing in tandem with MMA’s official recognition by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, one of three such sports to have the state’s blessing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She’s a Muslim and people saw what she can do and then they thought, this we can also do,” says Yeoh.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While only 10 or so women trained at Yeoh’s fighting camp in Johor Bahru throughout 2013, in the wake of Osman’s October bout, and the hype surrounding the upcoming rematch builds, interest in MMA from female athletes has snowballed. In January alone, he has seen more than 20 women sign up.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to Cui, it’s emphasizing narratives like Osman’s and playing off historical geopolitical rivalries like the one that exists between Singapore and Malaysia that is essential to MMA sinking deep roots into emerging Asian markets. “It’s Malaysia versus Singapore and those guys have a very, very extremely heated competition,” he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When ONE FC started investing in Malaysia in earnest two years ago there were only a handful of MMA gyms. Fast-forward to 2014 and there are now more than 30 operating in the capital Kuala Lumpur. This only adds to the competition between the nations. Singapore currently has around 10 fighting gyms.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Singapore says they have better fighters, Malaysia says they have better fighters, so it’s a never-ending debate,” explains Yeoh.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But its not just regional rivalry that is stoking anticipation, as these women can actually fight. MMA blog Bloody Elbow nominated the third round of their previous encounter for the site’s “Round of the Year” for 2013.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For Osman, though, there’s only one prize in her sights. “I am definitely taking home the win in front of my hometown crowd,” she says. “First round knockout!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZqamBrg3C51KyjoqVdm7KurcueZKalkWKzqrPHrZyrZZGju2670qaYp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
