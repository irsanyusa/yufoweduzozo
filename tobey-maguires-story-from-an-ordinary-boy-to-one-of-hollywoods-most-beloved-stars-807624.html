They want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;famous and have lots of&nbsp;money, just like their heroes&nbsp;do. However, we&nbsp;often forget that behind every big shot in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>, there’s an&nbsp;actual human that had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;many sacrifices to&nbsp;get there. These are stories of&nbsp;effort, <a href=# title=discipline data-link=tag>discipline</a>, and patience.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> loves stories that teach&nbsp;us that dreams can come true. Tobey Maguire’s is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them. He&nbsp;went from a&nbsp;complicated childhood to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hollywood star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/72a/f4a/e3ca515310bbc619b0c2f3b8c7.jpeg><p>It&nbsp;was 1975 when <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tobias Vincent Maguire</a>, better known as&nbsp;Tobey Maguire, was born. His parents were fairly young and were just building a&nbsp;life for themselves. His 18-year-old mother, Wendy Brown, worked in&nbsp;advertising and was trying to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actress, while his 20-year-old father, Vincent Maguire, was a&nbsp;cook and worked in&nbsp;construction. When Tobey was two years old, his parents <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>divorced</a>.</p><p>This made his life a&nbsp;little more complicated than usual. As&nbsp;the actor recalled in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>: “I&nbsp;always had a&nbsp;roof over my&nbsp;head, but&nbsp;I slept on&nbsp;the couches of&nbsp;relatives, and some nights we&nbsp;wandered around a&nbsp;shelter. My&nbsp;family had food stamps and government health insurance. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;that, so&nbsp;my&nbsp;ambition initially was to&nbsp;earn money.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e9e/395/929d3c5021b7973b05b6ff131b.jpg><p>Clearly, his primary drive was money, and that made him think about following in&nbsp;his father’s footsteps. Becoming a&nbsp;chef would possibly be&nbsp;the quickest solution to&nbsp;financial problems; however, his mom <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>convinced him</a> to&nbsp;start taking acting classes. She gave him a&nbsp;hundred dollars to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so, and that would change Tobey’s life forever.</p><p>He&nbsp;was 12&nbsp;years old when he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> his acting classes and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few ads. He&nbsp;would later have small appearances in&nbsp;television series. But for him, being successful is&nbsp;more than just waiting for doors to&nbsp;open. “It’s not just about the opportunities out there, it’s about the attitudes. It’s about your ability to&nbsp;imagine a&nbsp;different future for yourself,” the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ba/bb0/1df88b5541a57f3da1910bd443.jpg><p>And when you have to&nbsp;live thinking about how to&nbsp;get through each day, you just put too much energy into that. Maguire <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>: “It’s about having your brain space occupied by&nbsp;worrying about what I’m going to&nbsp;eat or&nbsp;how I’m going to&nbsp;pay rent, which is&nbsp;something&nbsp;I have contended with in&nbsp;life. Once you’re not having to&nbsp;worry about that on&nbsp;a&nbsp;day-to-day basis, it&nbsp;allows you space to&nbsp;think about other things.”</p><p>As&nbsp;time went&nbsp;on, Tobey built a&nbsp;solid <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> in&nbsp;show business. He&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;appear with Robert De&nbsp;Niro and <a href=# title="Leonardo DiCaprio" data-link=tag>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> in&nbsp;1993’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>This Boy’s Life</i></a>. In&nbsp;1997, he&nbsp;was part of&nbsp;the cast for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Ice Storm</i></a>, while in&nbsp;2000&nbsp;he starred in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wonder Boys</i></a>, alongside <a href=# title="Michael Douglas" data-link=tag>Michael Douglas</a> and Robert Downy Jr.</p><p>The difficulties of&nbsp;his early career were now a&nbsp;thing of&nbsp;the past. “That’s how&nbsp;I see things. Your imagination is&nbsp;not tied to&nbsp;reality, infrastructure or&nbsp;statistics. I&nbsp;think our lives are a&nbsp;product of&nbsp;our imagination,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> the actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd8/538/e4d2e657a7832b0719aad46b06.jpg><p>Life as&nbsp;Tobey Maguire knew it&nbsp;changed in&nbsp;2002 when before the eyes of&nbsp;the world he&nbsp;became <a href=# title=Spider-Man data-link=tag>Spider-Man</a>, a&nbsp;movie that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paid him</a> four million dollars. In&nbsp;2003, he&nbsp;recorded <i>Seabiscuit</i> for which he&nbsp;received twelve million dollars more.</p><p>“When I&nbsp;first became successful, I&nbsp;was very conservative with my&nbsp;money. That definitely stems from my&nbsp;background. You know those lottery winners who win big and then spend all the money? That wouldn’t happen to&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;never wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the position where my&nbsp;expenses were so&nbsp;big that&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;keep making movie after movie,” the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c63/538/cc36c454a0b11e8c5618b0c7d7.jpg><p>There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;doubt about how important Peter Parker was in&nbsp;Tobey’s life. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>highest-paid</a> actor ever to&nbsp;play the web-slinging hero. He&nbsp;earned $17.5&nbsp;million, plus&nbsp;5% of&nbsp;the box office for <i>Spider-Man 2</i>; and $15&nbsp;million, plus 7.5% of&nbsp;the box office for the third installment. That’s enough to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;long vacation!</p><p>But to&nbsp;be&nbsp;successful, it’s not enough to&nbsp;dream about&nbsp;it. You need to&nbsp;work to&nbsp;go&nbsp;after&nbsp;it, that’s why the actor felt that to&nbsp;pursue his dreams he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;flow like water by&nbsp;adapting to&nbsp;new circumstances. “If&nbsp;there is&nbsp;something&nbsp;I really want, I&nbsp;find a&nbsp;strategy and work towards it&nbsp;until&nbsp;I get&nbsp;it, no&nbsp;matter what the odds,” Maguire <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bbb/6e6/a8217053ac8ea08e69971a2009.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2021, we&nbsp;saw Tobey Maguire’s return to&nbsp;the Marvel multiverse as&nbsp;Spider-Man in&nbsp;<i>Spider-Man, No&nbsp;Way Home</i>. However, the actor has played other characters that required physical changes from him and histrionic abilities that speak of&nbsp;his professionalism on&nbsp;set. On&nbsp;the other hand, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>veganism</a> and the practice of&nbsp;yoga speak of&nbsp;his commitment to&nbsp;himself.</p><p><i>Babylon</i> will <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>premiere</a> in&nbsp;2023, where we&nbsp;will see Charles Chaplin played by&nbsp;Tobey, the same one who took acting classes at&nbsp;12&nbsp;years old and eventually taught&nbsp;us that when you want something with all your heart and work to&nbsp;get&nbsp;it, life will most likely end up&nbsp;rewarding you.</p><p>What is&nbsp;that dream you have yet to&nbsp;fulfill? What would you be&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;for&nbsp;it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGwrsSyZKaZl6q2s7HSZqqtp6Kueqe%2BzqZkmqZdpL%2Bltc2aqbJlkqTGbsDOZqannV2ks260zqWjsq%2BfpLG0ecyoqq1lkpq5sMLEnWSsrJGnwG6Ej3Bta2xf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
