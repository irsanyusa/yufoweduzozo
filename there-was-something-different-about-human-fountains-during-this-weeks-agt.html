One of those acts was Human Fountains, who are looking a little different these days. Did you notice?</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-human-fountains-features-different-people-on-agt>Human Fountains Features Different People on AGT</h2><p>During Wednesday’s performance, Human Fountains did what they do best — spat water into each other’s mouths. They even got judge Heidi Klum to join in. She was fine with being the first one to spit, but she ducked out of the way when she was the last in line.</p><p>The performance received mix reactions from fans online, but there was one thing about the act that most people didn’t seem to notice. As one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">user wrote</a> in the comments on YouTube, “Those do not look like the original ‘Human Fountain’ guys.”</p><p>If you were paying close attention to the group’s recent performances, you might have noticed that the three people who performed on Wednesday were not the same as those who performed on AGT: All-Stars earlier this year (who were the same trio on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spain’s Got Talent‘s version of All-Stars</a>).</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MEET THE PROFESSIONAL WATER SPITTING GROUP THE HUMAN FOUNTAINS, COMPETING ON ‘AGT: ALL-STARS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLgyhcxj5c&feature=youtu.be</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-group-has-several-members>The Group Has Several Members</h2><p>If you were wondering why the members of Human Fountains looked different on Wednesday night — don’t worry, they weren’t imposters. The group simply has several members who take turns performing together.</p><p>In December of last year, when the group was getting ready to perform as part of Superstars Live, they announced on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> that they had added five new members to the group. You might recognize three of them as the people who performed on this week’s results show.</p><p>In fact, the group has been changing ever since they first appeared on AGT in Season 13. During their audition, there were four of them. In later performances, there were five. But a lot of viewers are probably so distracted by the spitting that they don’t even notice.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_CherylBurke_-Unique-NicoleWireImage-220x197.jpg alt="Cheryl Burke Shares Heartfelt Goodbye to Her Home of 16 Years" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the human fountains</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706Gcq51drK60edKopJ6smJ67qHnDop2fnaKau7V5wJumrqxdncKurc1mnaitnqmuqrrSZpuuqpmjtG7Ax6KqZq%2BVmri0ecCgq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
