He claims that he lost a Channel 4 travel show after private comments he made about contestants were leaked. These comments allegedly caused damage to his reputation and earnings.</strong></p><p>If you missed it, David Walliams leaked comments include derogatory remarks about people auditioning for the talent show. Walliams used offensive language to describe some of the contestants. He now is seeking legal action against the production company, Fremantle, for allegedly violating data protection laws and breaching his privacy.</p><p>In the lawsuit, Walliams listed several withdrawn job offers, including the complete cancellation of a travel show for Channel 4. However, Channel 4 has not commented on this matter, stating that the cancellation was unrelated to Walliams’ comments on BGT.</p><p>In addition to the Channel 4 show, Walliams claimed that the BBC withdrew part of its funding for an animation series based on his children’s book, Gangsta Granny. He also mentioned that a musical adaptation of the same book by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>‘s Really Useful Group was no longer in the works.</p><p>According to the legal document, Walliams estimates that he lost nearly £1.8 million in earnings from appearances and performances since the leaks. This includes a £1 million contract for the 2023 season of BGT. The lawsuit also states that Walliams’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mental health</a> suffered as a result of the issue, and he had “uncontrollable negative thoughts,” including “active suicidal thoughts.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bgt-prepared-to-robustly-defend-itself-over-david-walliams-claims>BGT Prepared to “Robustly Defend” Itself Over David Walliams Claims</h2><p>In response to the legal action brought forth by former judge Walliams, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BGT</a> is ready to “robustly defend” itself. Walliams has launched a multi-million-pound legal claim against the production company Fremantle, seeking up to £10 million in lost earnings and damages.</p><p>The lawsuit centers on Walliams’ data protection case, alleging that his microphone was continuously recording during filming, including during breaks. They collected and transcribed thousands of hours of recordings, including sensitive and private conversations, without Walliams’ consent or knowledge.</p><p>Fremantle expressed both shock and sadness over the legal action, stating their willingness to resolve the matter amicably through dialogue. However, they are also prepared to defend themselves vigorously in response to the allegations. Walliams’ exit from the show in 2022 led to his replacement by former Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli on the judging panel, alongside Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, and Alesha Dixon.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_MauricioUmansky_KyleRichards_Paul-ArchuletaGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Kyle Richards Deletes Support for Mauricio Umansky on ‘DWTS’ Amid Emma Slater Dating Rumors" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qtopxdrK6tuMiapKxlnqTEbq%2FLmqCmq12Xr6R5wq6rZp6lo7GqusasZJ%2BnomK1qr%2BMp6awZZOWu6Sxy56bZqyilsOmuIysn6ivXZaztbHRZqOemZuasW6uxq1knKedorKvwNJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
