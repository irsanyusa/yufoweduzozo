My boss is my friend and flew to my Hawaii performance for the three hour performance and flew back home the same night,” the user wrote on Reddit. “I also have numerous screenshots and there is a lawsuit being filed for defamation of character. There is absolutely no truth behind this and I have never been pregnant!
