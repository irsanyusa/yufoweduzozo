What they definitely need is&nbsp;love. Unfortunately, sometimes women tend to&nbsp;see love when it’s not really there.</p><p>Sometimes a&nbsp;woman can feel that something is&nbsp;wrong without having to&nbsp;hear it&nbsp;from her partner. We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>gathered a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;10&nbsp;signs that a&nbsp;man’s strong feelings of&nbsp;love and adoration have faded. We&nbsp;hope that you won’t see these signs from your man, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;know what to&nbsp;look out for.</p><p><h2>Criticism of&nbsp;appearance</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/303/e88/6274ed507b89757bc365cd89a1.jpg><p>Omar Khayyam said, “A&nbsp;person will like everything, even the flaws, of&nbsp;their beloved, but will be&nbsp;annoyed at&nbsp;the perfection of&nbsp;those whom he&nbsp;does not love.” <strong>For a&nbsp;truly loving man, you are always beautiful, even with messy hair and even in&nbsp;your oversized nightgown.</strong> He&nbsp;will not notice that you have gained a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;extra pounds after the winter holidays if&nbsp;you do&nbsp;not say it&nbsp;yourself. But if&nbsp;your man constantly tells you to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the gym or&nbsp;hints that you need plastic surgery, do&nbsp;not rush to&nbsp;indulge him. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;most likely that <strong>it’s not your appearance that doesn’t suit him but you yourself</strong>. And even if&nbsp;you lose weight, he&nbsp;will find other faults in&nbsp;you.</p><p><h2>Discussing your shortcomings with friends</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/375/fb9/ce56ee57c8849a3cc864380488.jpg><p>Women tend to&nbsp;discuss problems in&nbsp;relationships or&nbsp;their partner’s shortcomings with their friends, while men try to&nbsp;keep everything unspoken.<strong> No&nbsp;one is&nbsp;perfect but truly loving people focus on&nbsp;the advantages of&nbsp;the partner instead of&nbsp;focusing on&nbsp;the flaws.</strong></p><p>If&nbsp;your partner allows himself to&nbsp;publicly humiliate you and laughs at&nbsp;your failures, do&nbsp;not expect anything good from such a&nbsp;relationship. Such a&nbsp;partner doesn’t respect you, and a&nbsp;strong and reliable union is&nbsp;impossible without respect. <strong>By&nbsp;criticizing you with other people, he&nbsp;unconsciously tries to&nbsp;prove to&nbsp;others (and himself) that it’s your fault that he&nbsp;stopped loving you.</strong></p><p><h2>His attitude toward your habits</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da4/087/717f0d515292e5eb3a25c6594d.jpg><p>Women like to&nbsp;complain about men’s socks scattered around the house but they also sometimes have annoying or&nbsp;strange habits. We&nbsp;like to&nbsp;occupy the bathroom for 2&nbsp;hours and chat with our girlfriends as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible, fill the wardrobe with unnecessary stuff, eat from our boyfriend’s plate, or&nbsp;keep singing the same song all day long. Loving men, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, endure all this and remain silent or&nbsp;react with humor. <strong>If&nbsp;your man is&nbsp;constantly scrutinizing every little thing you do&nbsp;and making negative comments about your behavior, it&nbsp;means that the only feeling he&nbsp;has left is&nbsp;irritation instead of&nbsp;love.</strong></p><p><h2>Attentiveness to&nbsp;your stories</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/339/163/4987bc5b7aa28a12f9f269d9c6.jpg><p>Scientists have <a href=#>proved </a>that a&nbsp;man is&nbsp;able to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman attentively for only 6&nbsp;minutes. That’s why, ladies, the next time you plan to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;conversation with your beloved, keep it&nbsp;short. The topics on&nbsp;which it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very difficult for a&nbsp;man to&nbsp;concentrate are unfamiliar people, celebrities, shopping, fashion, and diets. If&nbsp;possible, it’s best to&nbsp;discuss these types of&nbsp;things with your friends.</p><p>And yet, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;man sees that something is&nbsp;very important to&nbsp;you, he&nbsp;will make an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;you attentively, even if&nbsp;this topic is&nbsp;completely uninteresting to&nbsp;him. <strong>When he&nbsp;loves you, he&nbsp;won’t leave you without attention. But if&nbsp;he&nbsp;keeps changing the topic or&nbsp;runs away using different excuses whenever you try to&nbsp;talk, most likely, your worries do&nbsp;not bother him.</strong> Accordingly, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;the resolution of&nbsp;any issues that may come up&nbsp;during the relationship.</p><p><h2>His attitude toward your emotions</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4b/288/cee361590ebfdb1eb4a43911e5.jpg><p>Men absolutely cannot stand women’s tears. And recently, a&nbsp;scientific <a href=#>explanation </a>has been found: it&nbsp;turns out that female tears contain special volatile substances that lower the level of&nbsp;testosterone in&nbsp;the blood of&nbsp;men which leads to&nbsp;a&nbsp;decrease in&nbsp;sexual desire. So&nbsp;do&nbsp;not use crying as&nbsp;a&nbsp;means of&nbsp;influencing your beloved often.</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, when you cry, the only thing a&nbsp;man wants to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;run away and not see&nbsp;it. But <strong>if&nbsp;he&nbsp;loves you, he&nbsp;will pull himself together and do&nbsp;everything he&nbsp;can to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;comfort you even if&nbsp;the reason you’re crying seems trivial to&nbsp;him</strong>. He&nbsp;will calm down only when you start smiling again. However,<strong> if&nbsp;he&nbsp;doesn’t love you, then your tears will be&nbsp;just one more reason to&nbsp;get angry at&nbsp;you</strong>.</p><p><h2>Flirtatiousness</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d7/f08/cc366850a992a0debae3f08f4c.jpg><p>Flirting is&nbsp;very <a href=#>good </a>for relationships. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great tool to&nbsp;revive feelings and overcome routine when you have been together for a&nbsp;long time. Text messages, intriguing hints, playful photos&nbsp;— all this helps rekindle mutual interest, as&nbsp;in&nbsp;the first days of&nbsp;the relationship.<strong> Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very important that both partners actively respond to&nbsp;each other’s advances</strong>.</p><p>However, if&nbsp;you have already sent 10&nbsp;erotic selfies in&nbsp;different poses to&nbsp;your partner and have been coming up&nbsp;with new lines, but the reaction from your man is&nbsp;zero, <strong>stop doing&nbsp;it</strong>. Or&nbsp;consider what could be&nbsp;causing your partner to&nbsp;ignore your advances.</p><p><h2>His reaction to&nbsp;requests</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e3/efc/4e529c5df29d187724e5f42127.jpg><p>For a&nbsp;loving man, the requests and wishes of&nbsp;his beloved (not friends or&nbsp;distant relatives) will always take first place. <strong>In&nbsp;fact, men like to&nbsp;help women&nbsp;— this gives them the opportunity to&nbsp;demonstrate how cool, strong, and responsible they are</strong>. Of&nbsp;course, there are situations when a&nbsp;man cannot help, for example, he&nbsp;does not know how to&nbsp;repair a&nbsp;faucet, but he&nbsp;certainly should not leave you alone to&nbsp;deal with this problem&nbsp;— he&nbsp;will call the plumber, instead. However, if&nbsp;the most innocent request, like asking for help changing a&nbsp;lightbulb, is&nbsp;perceived with annoyance and as&nbsp;just “yet another unbearable task,” <strong>the relationship is&nbsp;worth reconsidering. Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;possible that your man is&nbsp;helping some other woman and with greater enthusiasm?</strong></p><p><h2>Jealousy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/353/73a/8bb4f156fe8086a4ce8a8ecf24.jpg><p>It&nbsp;turns out that even <a href=#>monkeys </a>are able to&nbsp;feel jealous of&nbsp;their partners around other males. Jealousy arose in&nbsp;the course of&nbsp;evolution as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;maintain the integrity of&nbsp;the couple. <strong>A&nbsp;man is&nbsp;wired so&nbsp;that subconsciously he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;declare his rights to&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the only “owner” of&nbsp;her beauty. </strong>Therefore, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;quite natural that your man starts to&nbsp;get nervous when someone pays attention to&nbsp;you. But people, of&nbsp;course, are not monkeys, and bouts of&nbsp;excessive jealousy will only harm the relationship.</p><p><strong>But when a&nbsp;man is&nbsp;absolutely indifferent to&nbsp;the signs of&nbsp;attention that other men show his lady, this is&nbsp;an&nbsp;alarming sign.</strong> He&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer wants to&nbsp;fight for her and doesn’t want to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;become better to&nbsp;stay the best for her.</p><p><h2>Protection from danger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b9/40b/558da257f98277d3bc776962e8.jpg><p><strong>The need to&nbsp;protect their loved ones is&nbsp;also the basis for men while the need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;protected is&nbsp;the basis for women.</strong> And although modern men no&nbsp;longer have to&nbsp;protect the weaker sex from predators and wild tribes, there are still dangers in&nbsp;our troubled world. Therefore, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;pretty natural that a&nbsp;loving man becomes worried when his second half comes back from work late or&nbsp;is&nbsp;alone in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unfamiliar place. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;cannot be&nbsp;around, then he’ll at&nbsp;least call her and make sure she’s fine. <strong>By&nbsp;protecting a&nbsp;woman from threats, whether real or&nbsp;imaginary ones, a&nbsp;man feels like a&nbsp;superhero</strong>.</p><p>Therefore, if&nbsp;you do&nbsp;not get protection and support from a&nbsp;man in&nbsp;difficult situations, such as&nbsp;having to&nbsp;walk home alone at&nbsp;night, getting lost in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unfamiliar city, or&nbsp;getting yelled at&nbsp;by&nbsp;your boss, <strong>this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very bad sign</strong>. Your chosen one is&nbsp;either a&nbsp;coward or&nbsp;simply doesn’t like you. Why do&nbsp;you need him then?</p><p><h2>Gentle words and expressing feelings</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/57e/5e3/3d837c53e4a0e0d6e134d1fcf7.jpg><p>The language of&nbsp;love consists of&nbsp;tender words, touches, hugs, and kisses. When we&nbsp;call a&nbsp;partner things like “sweetheart,” “darling,” or&nbsp;“dear,” we&nbsp;create a&nbsp;special intimate atmosphere. The choice of&nbsp;affectionate names occurs unconsciously and shows how one partner relates to&nbsp;the other, who dominates the relationship, and how well they are balanced.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, men need all this lovey-dovey stuff just as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;women&nbsp;do. Researchers from the&nbsp;US interviewed 1,000 married couples and <a href=#>found </a>that those husbands who often kiss and hug with their wives feel 3&nbsp;times happier in&nbsp;a&nbsp;marriage than those who don’t.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ae/c6b/34abf157b6979ac4a669191398.jpg><p>So&nbsp;if&nbsp;your man frowns every time you try to&nbsp;hug him and call “sweetheart,” the reason is&nbsp;not his natural male rigor. As&nbsp;sad as&nbsp;it&nbsp;may sound, his feelings have probably faded away.</p><p>What type of&nbsp;behavior do&nbsp;you think is&nbsp;the most upsetting?
