With the rumored premiere date landing in September, professional dancers have begun confirming whether or not they’ll appear in the upcoming season.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jenna Johnson, Val Chmerkovskiy Return for DWTS Season 32</h2><p>Longtime fans of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With the Stars</a> can rest easy knowing that pro dancers turned real life couple, Jenna Johnson and Val Chmerkovskiy will return to the ballroom this season. Although Chmerkovskiy had a long run with his Season 31 partner Gabby Windey, his wife was on the bench for the season. The professional sat out of the season while expecting their first child.</p><p>Even though parenthood can be demanding, both new parents have agreed to take part in the upcoming season of DWTS. Chmerkovskiy confirmed their upcoming appearance while talking to US Weekly about his newest Subway partnership.</p><p>“Yes, I am coming back next season. I’m very excited,” Chmerkovskiy said. “I had an amazing season 31, so hopefully I could ride the momentum into season 32.”</p><p>While talking about his wife, he admitted that she’s his biggest competition. He even joked that he got her out of the competition by impregnating her.</p><p>“Jen, you know, I got rid of my stiffest competition by impregnating her,” Chmerkovskiy said. “I don’t know if I could do it two seasons in a row, but she is so inspired and she’s yearning to be back on Dancing With the Stars, so I’m excited to see what she creates next season.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-peta-murgatroyd-may-return-to-the-ballroom>Peta Murgatroyd May Return to The Ballroom</h2><p>In the same interview, Val Chmerkovskiy’s brother Maksim, revealed the fate of his wife’s time on DWTS. Last season, Murgatroyd’s partner was Sex and The City’s Jason Lewis. Unfortunately the duo didn’t make it too far since they were eliminated in the first week of the competition. A few months later, Murgatroyd announced her pregnancy with their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">second child</a>.</p><p>Although Maksim Chmerkovskiy didn’t fully confirm his wife’s involvement in the upcoming season, it wasn’t denied. While confirming Johnson’s return, Val Chmerkovskiy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>: “I think both of them are gonna be on next season” implying that Murgatroyd will return as well.</p><p>It makes sense that Murgatroyd’s involvement hasn’t been officially confirmed just yet, since she’s set to give birth in June. Regardless, Maksim Chmerkovskiy admitted that he’s ready for the long nights with their newborn.</p><p>“Honestly, me personally, I’m looking forward to … the sleepless nights [which] I enjoyed [with Shai]. I’m fine with [the lack of sleep], but like, when he was crying, I was coming in and I was in the corner posting up and just kind of rocking him to sleep,” he said. “I had as much fun doing it as somebody looking at like, ‘Oh, you know, this is an amazing [time].’ It was selfish and I’m looking forward to another selfish period of time of enjoying a baby.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Maksim Chmerkovskiy Returning to DWTS?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maksim Chmerkovskiy</a> is unfortunately not returning to the ballroom this fall, but it doesn’t seem like he’s against the idea for the future. For those who may not know, Chmerkovskiy left the show in 2018 after 17 seasons, including one All Star season in the ballroom.</p><p>“Just ask me politely,” he said. “Honestly, with me, all it always takes is just gimme a hug. If you can get through the ‘what it looks like’ and the unapproachableness … and into the hug area, it’s just an immediately different Maks.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_DragRace8_Cast_viaIG-220x147.jpg alt="‘RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars 8’ Shares First Look, Guest Judge Roster, Audience Voting" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZ6lp5ldn7yputKopWaukaF6pLTMnqmkp6aouKrFjKycrWWkpHqzsdOuqadllqS%2FbrDWrapmq5WWwLC6jGxpaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
