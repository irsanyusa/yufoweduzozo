You probably already know that if you’re in the overwhelming throes of wedding preparation. It’s hard to decide which songs will perfectly capture the unique essence of your love while also creating and sustaining the ideal atmosphere. And just as you’ve likely learned from other aspects of planning your big day, you can’t please everyone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Instead, focus on what you and your beloved will be happiest to hear on your big day (and maybe throw in a guided dance number or two, just to keep everyone engaged). Here are 10 ideas for songs to play at your wedding.<b></b></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“L-O-V-E” by Nat King Cole</b></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is a heartwarming classic that will unite the generations and get everyone singing along. That’s true whether they first heard it when it was released in 1964, or when it played in the iconic opening credits of the 1998 <i>Parent Trap </i>remake.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“A Case of You” by Joni Mitchell</b></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“A Case of You” was released on <a href=#>Joni Mitchell</a>’s seminal 1971 album <i>Blue. </i>Some say it was inspired by the singer’s relationship with Graham Nash, while others believe it was written about Leonard Cohen. Either way, it’s one of the most romantic tracks of all time, and the perfect song for a meaningful slowdance moment.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)” by Whitney Houston</b></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Whitney Houston</a> wanted to dance with somebody who loved her, and so does everyone at your wedding! (Or at least, somebody who will show them a good time on the dance floor.) One of the best parts of a wedding is the chance it provides to surround yourself with loved ones and celebrate, so use Houston’s unparalleled exuberance as a chance to pull your friends onto the floor.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>The 10 Best Songs of 2021</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Good Grief” by Bastille/”</b><b>Good Grief (Don Diablo Remix)” by Bastille, Don Diablo</b><b></b></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many people have lost someone they love dearly, who they wish could be at their wedding. “Good Grief” taps into that feeling of desire to share your joy with someone you miss, and creates an opportunity for remembrance (without grinding the event to a halt the way that, say, “Candle In the Wind” would). The remixed version is even more upbeat, and dance-y enough that while it still provides a moment of bittersweet catharsis, it’s possible that half the guests blithely getting down to a song about grief might not even notice.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“I Belong to You” by Brandi Carlile</b></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Brandi Carlile’s soulful vocals and moving lyrics provide another opportunity to slow things down and revel in the beauty of your big day, and your love for your partner. “I know I could be spending a little too much time with you,” she sings. “But time and too much don’t belong together like we do / If I had all my yesterdays I’d give ’em to you too / I belong to you now.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Everytime We Touch” by Cascada</b></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s nothing like a throwback to get people excited, especially one that’s aged like a fine wine. Whether your guests first heard this song when it was going platinum in the U.S. and soundtracking high school dances around the world, or are becoming acquainted with it for the first time at your wedding, every time “Everytime We Touch” plays, everyone has a good time. (And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.)</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Make Me Feel” by Janelle Monáe</b></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Make Me Feel,” an infectious bop that <a href=#>Janelle Monáe</a> has said was influenced by Prince, is an ideal pick for celebrating yourself and your love while you’re both feeling yourselves and one another.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Fast Car” by Tracy Chapman/”</b><b>Fast Car (Steegra Remix)” by Tracy Chapman, Steegra</b></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Fast Car” is a powerfully romantic and hopeful folk-pop song that reached No. 6 on the <i>Billboard </i>Hot 100 and won <a href=#>Tracy Chapman</a> a 1989 Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The remix is all of those things, too, but faster and with more synth—choose whichever fits your crowd best.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>The Best K-Pop Songs and Albums of 2021</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Cupid Shuffle” by Cupid</b></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sure, it’s cheesy. But every wedding needs an icebreaker song—something that gets people onto the dance floor with the reassuring promise that they’ll be told exactly what to do by the song itself, and that they won’t look any sillier than anyone else.<b></b></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)” by Beyoncé</b></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nothing beats the unadulterated triumph of dancing with your freshly minted spouse to a song you’ve probably heard a thousand times, knowing that <i>this time, </i>you both liked it so much that you <i>did </i>put a ring on it. Bonus points if someone at the wedding starts doing the dance from the music video (and extra bonus points if that someone is you and your partner).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaWhlgnh%2BjpucrKxdrLKlsMinnmarn6O0tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
