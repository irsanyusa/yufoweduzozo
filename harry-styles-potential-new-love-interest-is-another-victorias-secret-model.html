Now, it appears that he has set his sights on Candice Swanepoel, who would be the lucky seventh Angel to date him.</p><p>Styles and Swanepoel first crossed paths in 2017 when he performed at the Victoria’s Secret fashion show in Shanghai. Since then, rumors of their budding romance have surfaced, indicating that they have grown close. While nothing has been confirmed, sources suggest that Styles is mesmerized by Swanepoel’s beauty and success as one of Victoria’s Secret’s most accomplished Angels.</p><p>What makes this potential pairing interesting is the historical context. Styles has established a captivating romantic history with Victoria’s Secret models throughout his career. It all began in 2013 when he was linked to fellow British model Cara Delevingne. Followed by a high-profile relationship with American beauty Kendall Jenner in 2014. Their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">romance</a>, however, was short-lived.</p><p>Over the years, Styles has been involved with several other Victoria’s Secret Angels. These include Nadine Leopold, Sara Sampaio, Georgia Fowler, and Camille Rowe. Each relationship had its own unique story, adding fuel to the media frenzy surrounding Styles’ love life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Harry Styles’ New Love Interest, Candice Swanepoel?</h2><p>Swanepoel is a South African model who rose to prominence through her work with Victoria’s Secret. Known for her stunning beauty and captivating presence on the runway, Swanepoel has made a name for herself in the fashion industry. She has worked with renowned brands and labels such as Fendi, Chanel, Versace, and Ralph Lauren, solidifying her status as a sought-after model.</p><p>Beyond her successful career, Swanepoel is also recognized for her philanthropic efforts. In 2019, she was announced as a patron and global ambassador for mothers2mothers, a charity dedicated to achieving an HIV-free generation of children and mothers in Africa. This showcases her commitment to making a positive impact and giving back to her community.</p><p>Since her split from model Hermann Nicoli in 2018, with whom she shares two children, Swanepoel has been publicly single.
