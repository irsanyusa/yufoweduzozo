So it was pretty fun to be back in the studio with him training.”</p><p>Arnold said she missed dancing, pointing out that it’s a great cardio workout. She said she was “sweating buckets” during her lesson with Armstrong. Arnold called the experience “so fun,” but she told fans that it “doesn’t mean anything other than I just really wanted to dance again.”</p><p>She went on to share a clip of her and Armstrong in the studio dancing to Dua Lipa’s “Levitating.” Arnold said her “whole body is so sore,” adding that she was “definitely out of dancing shape.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LINDSAY ARNOLD DETAILS BABY JUNE’S BIRTH STORY IN NEWEST VLOG EPISODE</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-arnold-took-season-31-off-from-dwts>Arnold Took Season 31 Off from DWTS</h2><p>Last year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arnold announced</a> that she would not be returning to the Dancing with the Stars ballroom for Season 31, as she didn’t want to make the move from her home in Utah to Los Angeles to film in the show.</p><p>At the time, Arnold’s daughter Sage was just one year old, and she and her husband Sam Cusick were trying for another baby.
