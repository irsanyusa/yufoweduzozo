Notably, past contestant Alyssa Raghu made a comeback during the episode.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alyssa-raghu-returns-for-american-idol-season-22>Alyssa Raghu Returns for American Idol Season 22</h2><p>During Sunday’s episode, Julia Davo auditioned for the show with a cover of “Life on Mars?” by David Bowie. Lionel Richie compared her to Lady Gaga, voting yes. However, his fellow judges weren’t sold on her talent just yet, voting no.</p><p>Julia happened to be there with her best friend and roommate Alyssa Raghu, who previously appeared on the show in 2018 and 2019, making it into the Top 8 during her second season. She came in to hug the judges after Julia had been rejected.</p><p>Alyssa ended up asking the judges if they’d listen to her sing something for them. She performed “My All” by Mariah Carey. Perry was shocked to discover that Alyssa wanted another chance to be on the show. She called it “a really weird plot twist,” adding that she doesn’t think Alyssa could win the show.</p><p>However, Richie and Luke Bryan voted yes to sending her through. As Bryan presented Alyssa with her Golden Ticket, Perry stood up from the judges’ table and walked away, seeming annoyed.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SINGER GETS GROUP HUG FROM THE JUDGES IN ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ AUDITION</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-audition-process-changed-one-singer-s-life>The Audition Process Changed One Singer’s Life</h2><p>Sunday’s episode also featured an audition from 24-year-old Dave Fio, who shared how the audition process affected his life. He shared that when he saw himself in his original audition video, he “didn’t recognize the person.”</p><p>“So that day, I went sober, and I hit the gym, and I threw the bad food in the house away,” Dave shared. “It’s been about 12 weeks, and I’m down 65 pounds. Got me some department store clothes. I’m new boot goofin’.”</p><p>Dave chose to sing “Save Me” by Jelly Roll, showing off a powerful emotion and a growl to his voice. The judges did an exercise with him to lessen the grit in his voice. Richie didn’t think he was ready, but Perry and Bryan both voted yes to sending Dave to Hollywood.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-contestant-s-sister-convinces-the-judges>Contestant’s Sister Convinces the Judges</h2><p>During Sunday’s show, 20-year-old Athena Jett showed up to her audition with her 12-year-old sister Angelina, who gifted Perry a handmade purse for her daughter Daisy. Athena performed “Somebody New” by Sophia James.</p><p>Perry thought that Athena’s nerves affected her performance. That’s when Angelina cut in to tell the judges that she had heard her sister sing “Never Enough” from The Greatest Showman. The judges said they wanted to hear that from Athena.</p><p>The moment made Perry emotional, as she said, “This is why we do this show.” The judges voted yes to sending Athena to Hollywood, as Perry admitted she would have been a no before the second song. Angelina presented her sister with her Golden Ticket.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Original_AGT_S18Cast_Finale_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="‘America’s Got Talent’ Announces Season 19 Premiere Date, Confirms Judges" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Alyssa Raghu</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57z5qqrWWRorKztcKapWahlKS5bq%2FOp6ueq6SWu7V50Z6rrqqeqHqiv4ysnJqrn6N6c36MmqydoaSevK%2B%2FjJymp6yZo8Kmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
