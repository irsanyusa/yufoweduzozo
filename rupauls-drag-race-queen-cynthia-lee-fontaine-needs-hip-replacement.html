After appearing on seasons eight and nine of RuPaul’s Drag Race, Fontaine recovered from liver cancer. The good news doesn’t last long however, as he is now diagnosed with a new illness that needs constant treatment.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-drag-queen-is-diagnosed-with-necrosis>The Drag Queen is Diagnosed with Necrosis</h2><p>This is all sad news for fans of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RuPaul’s Drag Race</a> star, since her health issues are preventing her from performing. Following her treatment for stage one undiagnosed liver cancer, the Puerto Rican native revealed she lost a lot of blood during the process.</p><p>As a result of the loss of blood supply, Fontaine was diagnosed with avascular necrosis, a condition that causes death to bone tissue. The necrosis happened as a direct effect of the blood loss Fontaine had from the cancer treatment.</p><p>“Sadly I have been dealing with a lot of pain on my hips since last year,” Fontaine said. “This was due to exposure to my chemo treatment and also steroids back in the days when I was battling cancer.”</p><p>Two surgeries have been scheduled for Fontaine to undergo with the first one happening this Wednesday, and the other in January. Recovery is going to be a long and slow process for the drag queen, taking six months or more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Drag Queens Voice Support for Fontaine</h2><p>Fellow drag queens have voiced their support for Fontaine to overcome her recent health challenges.

Meanwhile, season seven contestant Mrs. Kasha Davis also sent well wishes for Fontaine on her post.</p><p>“Love you! Thank you for always staying so positive and showing the world your love!

I’m so very encouraged by your brightness and positivity during this time of change and I KNOW you’ll power through your recovery with determination and LOVE!
