The woman described how her 11-year-old daughter made a&nbsp;drawing of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pig, and it&nbsp;provoked a&nbsp;huge scandal out of&nbsp;nowhere. The innocent drawing was called “inappropriate” because of&nbsp;one detail that <a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a> management saw in&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;call from school made the mom totally angry.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec6/ce0/0416ee5ba28f1c5b1db03abb9c.jpg><p>An&nbsp;extremely furious mum has slammed her 11-year-old daughter’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>school</a> after her drawing was confiscated. The school staff deemed it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;“inappropriate”.</p><p>Sierra Carter was fuming when she discovered that her child’s innocent picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pig in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bow-tie saying “hi” was taken from her. The drawing showed a&nbsp;<a href=# title=pink data-link=tag>pink</a> Peppa Pig-like farmyard animal dressed smartly with its legs in&nbsp;the air.</p><p>But the Hanover-Horton Elementary School teacher said the pig’s bow tie depicted a&nbsp;forbidden element.</p><p><h2>The scandal appeared out of&nbsp;nowhere.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e01/5b1/4d8c555700bf66a09274ebf525.jpg><p>The angry mom has since attended meetings with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>teacher</a>, a&nbsp;social worker, and the principal. But she claims that the matter has not yet been resolved, and says the picture is&nbsp;still being kept on&nbsp;her daughter’s record. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;candid video, which so&nbsp;far has more than 1, 000,000&nbsp;views, Sierra spoke to&nbsp;the camera as&nbsp;she explained what has been happening.</p><p>She says, “I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;phone call from my&nbsp;daughter’s teacher&nbsp;— she is&nbsp;in&nbsp;fifth grade, she is&nbsp;11&nbsp;years old. Her teacher told me&nbsp;that my&nbsp;daughter had drawn something inappropriate in&nbsp;the art class, and that a&nbsp;little boy had come up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her and made her aware that he&nbsp;thought my&nbsp;daughter drew ‘boy parts’ on&nbsp;her pig project. She went over and asked my&nbsp;daughter for all of&nbsp;her papers. My&nbsp;daughter told her teacher straight away that she drew a&nbsp;bow tie.”</p><p>The woman angrily continues, “But the teacher proceeded to&nbsp;take all of&nbsp;her papers from her, and then she said she had to&nbsp;give my&nbsp;daughter’s project to&nbsp;the vice principal of&nbsp;the school.”</p><p><h2>Both mom and daughter faced criticism for nothing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/619/a19/58daaa5ba991b700ad0d287211.jpg><p>Sierra was then called into a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>meeting</a>, and she says, “I&nbsp;get there this morning, and they take me&nbsp;into a&nbsp;conference room, and&nbsp;I sit down with the teacher and the social worker for the school. They hand me&nbsp;her art project that was just “so&nbsp;offensive” and as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I look at&nbsp;it, I’m like, “Are you kidding&nbsp;me?”</p><p>The woman continues her epic story, saying, “I&nbsp;literally slammed my&nbsp;hand down on&nbsp;the table, and I&nbsp;said, “To&nbsp;be&nbsp;completely frank with you, I&nbsp;am furious. Why are we&nbsp;sitting here right now? And why was there a&nbsp;big deal made of&nbsp;this. It’s a&nbsp;bow tie.”</p><p>And then she described the reaction of&nbsp;the school staff, saying, “They tell me&nbsp;that when they gave it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the principal to&nbsp;ask him what his thoughts were on&nbsp;the whole thing, the first thing that he&nbsp;said was “write her&nbsp;up.”</p><p><h2>Internet users don’t see anything “offensive” and “prohibited” in&nbsp;the drawing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b72/dc5/45c8a15f47b81d90a20eda1a12.jpg><p>People were very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>active</a> in&nbsp;the comments under the video, mostly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>supporting</a> the mom and her daughter. One person wrote, “The social worker could have stopped this issue in&nbsp;seconds, shameful! The adults have their heads in&nbsp;the gutter.”</p><p>Another user added, “As&nbsp;an&nbsp;administrator, I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;sorry that you had to&nbsp;deal with this. When I&nbsp;saw the pic I&nbsp;thought, ‘you are kidding&nbsp;me’ keep sticking up&nbsp;for your kiddo!”</p><p>The third person commented, “You have GOT to&nbsp;be&nbsp;kidding&nbsp;me! That’s ridiculous! It’s clearly a&nbsp;bow tie and the teachers/principal/social worker should be&nbsp;ASHAMED!”</p><p>The “bow tie matter” went even further, and there’re even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>T-shirts</a> with the innocent drawing in&nbsp;some online stores. People try to&nbsp;support mom and daughter and add some humorous note to&nbsp;the whole story, which was for sure so&nbsp;unpleasant for them.</p><p>And here’s yet another <a href=#>school drama</a> story, this time a&nbsp;teacher is&nbsp;infuriated because she had to&nbsp;change her 6-year-old student’s diaper.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqwwMeeqWaho2Kztr7IqKysZZGbwaa%2BjKGcq2WUlsKotNOeqaxllKeuuLXNoGSwmaNisLC6xaKqnJmkmrFurdNmqpygn6S5bq3NnWSlmZKaua2xw2agp5mgpb%2BwvNGimK2dXW1%2BeICPamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
