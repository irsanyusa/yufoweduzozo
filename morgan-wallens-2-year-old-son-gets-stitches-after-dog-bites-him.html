And I just couldn’t bring myself to what everyone else says, and what you’re supposed to do, apparently,” Smith said, referring to euthanasia. She tearfully explained that Legend “does not deserve that” and “could do really great with a family that doesn’t have small children.”</p><p>Smith asked her followers for their help, as she wanted to avoid sending Legend to a shelter. She asked if anyone in the Nashville area was able to give the dog a home immediately. Smith emphasized that Legend is “not aggressive towards adults at all.”</p><p>She was also sure to let her followers know that Indigo will be okay, and he will have minimal scarring from the injury.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MORGAN WALLEN SHARES HOW BECOMING A FATHER CHANGED HIM</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-dog-will-be-going-to-a-new-home>The Dog Will Be Going to a New Home</h2><p>Smith shared her work phone number on Instagram stories, asking followers to only text her if they knew of a good home for Legend.
