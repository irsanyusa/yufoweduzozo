He said he was ready to do anything to get his mother back on her feets.</p><p>"At that point truthfully, if they told me that there was any cure in hell, I would have gone, you are talking about your mother you know. So I went, I remember I went there with my security, my sister, and my personal assistant. When we got there, there was a constant insistence that I come to church and I said to them, that wasn't the arrangement because the plan was to come...we brought her by air we kept her at a hospital nearby" said Jim Iyke.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"So the understanding was that you lay your hands on her for her to get better but they said No! you must come to church, their insistence forced me to go to the church...and I was there when the whole thing about touching people, I found it a little laughable seeing it on national tv...i remember my sister pinching me telling me to stop," he further said.</p><p>Looks like Jim Iyke is in the mood for revealing a lot of his past experiences as it would be recalled that a few days ago, the Nollywood actor while granting an interview with <strong>Broadway TV</strong>, revealed the major <a href=# id=597adf86-a498-5040-af1f-f2902dd6b8c6>reason he didn't get married to movie star</a>, <strong>Rita Dominic</strong>.</p><p>"I was just beginning to embrace fame, the laurels, the distractions and even the destructions, Rita is not a woman that waits around for that growth, we were very deep, we don't speak constantly, surprised that we haven't spoken in two years, when we see we are still cordial and respectful.</p><p>"I don't think at that time, Rita was looking for longevity, don't forget at that time I was with the afro, ready to fight anywhere, ready for as many conquests as possible, who wants that kind of guy?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"She tried to show me that there was so much in me that I was experiencing. I promise you, a Rita would not go out to hang out with a layabout but she said to me that I was too intelligent to be giving people that part of me. For her, it was an eye for an eye, I'll chase you done the street," he said.</p><p>When asked if Rita Dominic is the kind of woman he would love to marry. He, however, said that ship has sailed.</p><p>"I don't think so, we come from the same circle, she knows too much of what I know and I know too much about her. You need that opposite attraction to be able to survive the way I live. I want to come and hear about your day not about what I already know, I want to learn from you, I need you to teach me new tricks."</p><p>It would be recalled that while granting an interview with <strong>Punch</strong>, Jim Iyke dropped a bombshell about his relationship with <strong>Ghanaian</strong> actress, <strong>Nadia Buhari</strong>. He claimed <a href=# id=4d207dde-a367-5f42-918e-6c2c3854e770>the relationship was a scripted relationship</a> just to promote his reality television show "<strong>Jim Iyke Unscripted</strong>."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGajoZ1itrq3xGaYnKyfp3q1tMinoqxlmJp6uK3SZqSiq5yasW6u2Garm2WapMCpwcBooayopp2vrQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
