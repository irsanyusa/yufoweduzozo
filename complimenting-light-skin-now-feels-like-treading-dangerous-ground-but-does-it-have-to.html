It behoves us as a society to do this in a way that makes it easy for everyone to live out their true selves, enjoy their best lives and not have to cower or suffer identity crises or mental health issues resulting from things that are out of their control, such as colour and texture of the skin they were born in [or, to an extent, the size of said body].</p><p><strong>Are we seeing a new wave of colourism?</strong></p><p>In light of previous paragraphs, it is easy to get caught up in the melanin campaign and overdo it at the expense of other existing, established realities. It bears noting that while darker skin shades are now getting the global representation they’d been denied for so long, it doesn't make attention to light skin wrong.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In case you haven’t come across it, there is a strain of extreme feminism asking for more women to poison their spouses' meals. There was also <a href=# id=ec151bae-95de-41d4-be5b-3a34aa5fb601>this viral story</a> about a feminist claiming to have aborted a pregnancy once she found out it was a boy because she "couldn't bring another monster into the world." There have been rebuttals to that story but nothing is certain aside from the fact that she said what she said.</p><p>Yes, achieving equality and a safer world for women may require some radical measures, but surely, terminating baby boys in the womb and murdering men at their dining tables cannot be the way to go about that, right? This is a much bigger subject with greater and more dire consequences compared to the issues surrounding colourism. But you get the point.</p><p>There is a tendency for people to cross the line of reason and good judgement where things like these are concerned. But as a society, we have to come to a place of acceptance, a place of better understanding that two truths can coexist. Dark-skinned women can be elevated without casting light-skinned women down.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e96665f3-8ea8-4bb1-b388-549017c2a30e data-caption="Humans [Refinery]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/cJLktkpTURBXy9hNGQ4NzcyZjdhZDEzNmY1NDNhZjk0MjEwMTAzODYzMi5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAaDCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Also, every compliment, spotlight or conversation about beautiful light skin women isn't an attack on the existence and desirability of dark-skinned women. It’s not that deep and everything is not done out of malicious agenda.</p><p><strong>Las las, everyone just needs to calm down</strong></p><p>You can argue that this is a reductive way to view the issue but really, is it? Look around you; there are deeply-melanated queens getting their dues everywhere: <strong>Genevieve, Ini Edo, Saskay, Bisola, Kate Henshaw, Inidinma Okojie, Beverly Naya</strong>… the list goes on and on. And that is exactly how it should be, especially in Nigeria where dark-skinned people outnumber light-skinned ones considerably. Any order which tries to portray dark skin as inferior must be reversed. That’s pretty much the movement we started seeing globally about 4/5 years ago - and we must stress that it is a welcome one.</p><p>But seeking to change negative perceptions about dark skin by the erasure of the light skin folks, or shouting down any mention of them in public discourse cannot be right. If there is no problem with pointing out the gorgeousness of dark skin, then there should be none when the beauty of light skin is highlighted. After all, all skin types are beautiful and all body types are gorgeous, innit?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK%2BmrdStsGaglZa5tbSOnKamqJyeuqa606KloGWcnrSpwIysoqKmXaO8uHnFnpylq12htqyxjK2pnpmUnruoecOapaCdoqTCtHnGq6auppRir7bAjJ2mnqtdnsFutMCvnGasn2S6rIDCb6tp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
