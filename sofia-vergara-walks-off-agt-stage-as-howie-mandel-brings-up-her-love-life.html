The moment happened during a funny segment in which Vergara took a lie detector test.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofia-vergara-leaves-agt-stage-during-lie-detector-test>Sofia Vergara Leaves AGT Stage During Lie Detector Test</h2><p>During <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wednesday’s show</a>, host Terry Crews introduced the audience to something called the “Tot Seat,” inspired by the show’s sponsor Sonic. Vergara sat down in the chair (which looked like it was made out of tater tots) and answered questions submitted by fans.</p><p>Vergara was hooked up to a lie detector test to see if she was answering truthfully. Her fellow judges read out the questions, and it was revealed that Vergara thinks Mandel is the smartest judge. She also said she preferred AGT to Modern Family, which was apparently true.</p><p>At the end of the segment, Mandel asked Vergara, “Do you see anybody in the audience tonight that you’re interested in?” Vergara seemed shocked by the question. She ended up getting out of the Tot Seat and leaving the stage, saying, “That’s it.”</p><p>Vergara was smiling as she did it, so it’s safe to say she wasn’t actually offended by Mandel’s question. She wasn’t thrilled about participating in the segment from the very beginning, when her fellow judges volunteered her.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NETFLIX TEASES UPCOMING SOFIA VERGARA SERIES ‘GRISELDA’ WITH NEW POSTER</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mandel-keeps-bring-up-vergara-s-love-life>Mandel Keeps Bring Up Vergara’s Love Life</h2><p>This isn’t the first time Mandel has brought up Vergara’s love life during America’s Got Talent.

She even shared <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what she’s looking for</a> in a partner, saying, “Someone healthy, someone handsome, someone that has a great sense of humor. Someone that is happy with himself. That’s it.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_DrewBarrymore_Taylor-HillFilmMagic-220x147.jpeg alt="Drew Barrymore Has Been Dropped as the Host for The National Book Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qidopldq7Kzs8CrmGavkaG4tHnOn51mmZeperTAwKCcZpmjYrWww8ieZKaZnpmyrXnBq6Cnn6NiwrF5x56pZqSfq7JuuMifnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
