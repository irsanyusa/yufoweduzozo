The peculiarities of&nbsp;this civilization attract scientists and ordinary people, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;left many questions that have been waiting for answers for centuries. And the smartest people in&nbsp;the world are still racking their brains, trying to&nbsp;figure out their secrets.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;dive into the mysterious world of&nbsp;the Mayan people in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;learn the interesting facts about the civilization that disappeared just as&nbsp;suddenly as&nbsp;it&nbsp;appeared.</p><p><h2>They arrived from Siberia and founded more than 1,000 cities in&nbsp;South American jungles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4f/3da/711f2b5ce3a2b44b0e11a3ca34.jpg><p>Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>hi</p><p><strong>It’s not for nothing that the Mayan and the Siberian people look so&nbsp;alike.</strong> Experts <a href=#>suppose</a> that the roots of&nbsp;this civilization should be&nbsp;searched for in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;migrants from <a href=# title=Asia data-link=tag>Asia</a>. In&nbsp;fact, the Mayans made their way to&nbsp;the American continent from Siberia during the last Ice age. Many years passed before their ancestors put down roots in&nbsp;the sultry jungles of&nbsp;Central America.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, the native inhabitants of&nbsp;Chukotka, located in&nbsp;the far east of&nbsp;Russia, use the base-20 (base-score) numeral system instead of&nbsp;the decimal one. The Mayan people also <a href=#>used</a> this same system.</p><p>The development of&nbsp;civilization took place in&nbsp;the territory of&nbsp;the following modern states: <a href=# title=Mexico data-link=tag>Mexico</a>, Guatemala, Belize, El&nbsp;Salvador, and Honduras (western part). <strong>Researchers <a href=#>have found</a> hundreds of&nbsp;cities from the Mayan culture</strong>, but still, not all of&nbsp;them have been excavated and studied by&nbsp;archaeologists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ee/1f6/92441256b68ae58b4cef51bb44.jpg><p>The Mayans built special temple complexes&nbsp;— or&nbsp;pyramids&nbsp;— with the temple of&nbsp;Kukulcan being the most famous one. The most ancient ones date back to&nbsp;the 4th century BCE. These constructions had such special features like:</p><ul><li><strong>They <a href=#>were built</a> from local limestone and then covered with paint.</strong> For this reason, during the Mayan times, buildings looked different and were red in&nbsp;color.</li><li><strong>If&nbsp;you stand in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the pyramid’s main stairs and <a href=#>clap</a> your hands, you can hear this chirping echo.</strong> It&nbsp;sounds like the quetzal bird that was honored by&nbsp;the Indians of&nbsp;Mesoamerica.</li><li>Each of&nbsp;the 4&nbsp;staircases of&nbsp;the temple has 91&nbsp;steps, and their total number is&nbsp;364. Together with the base-platform that joins all the stairs on&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the pyramid, the total <a href=#>number</a> becomes 365&nbsp;— <strong>the number of&nbsp;days in&nbsp;a&nbsp;year</strong>.</li><li>The location and shape of&nbsp;the pyramids are designed in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that <strong>once a&nbsp;year the staircase <a href=#>casts</a> a&nbsp;shadow in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;snake,</strong> marking the day of&nbsp;the spring equinox.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/570/1ee/7dc5c959a98456b7a4c388f1f5.jpg><p><h2>Strange things that impress modern humans, but were normal things for the Mayan people</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/324/251/7590eb505c85e8df2b6dc9b4f4.jpg><p>It’s probably not a&nbsp;big revelation to&nbsp;know that the ancient Mayan people performed <a href=#>sacrifices</a>. But few people know that they were not actually very bloodthirsty people when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;those places and times: <strong>they actually sacrificed humans much more seldom than the Aztecs</strong>. Most of&nbsp;the rituals were the result of&nbsp;events like crop failures or&nbsp;wars, or&nbsp;they were connected with the consecration of&nbsp;new leaders or&nbsp;temples.</p><p>However, the Mayan people often sacrificed captives to&nbsp;the Gods. These captives were usually from neighboring tribes who they were fighting with.</p><p>Though they have achieved a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;many spheres of&nbsp;social life, the Mayans never mastered metallurgy. They were technically living in&nbsp;the Stone Age and were not aware of&nbsp;any more perfect tools than they were using. But they had their own methods of&nbsp;fighting with opponents. For example, <strong>Mayan warriors <a href=#>used</a> hornets and wasps nests placed in&nbsp;jars made of&nbsp;gourds, as&nbsp;throwing weapons</strong>. If&nbsp;they were thrown successfully, insects would create a&nbsp;panic in&nbsp;the ranks of&nbsp;the enemy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9cd/670/072e3c5fd18d9fd28f7c6fad62.jpg><p>The Mayans had a&nbsp;very specific and (not very European) understanding of&nbsp;beauty.<strong> They <a href=#>considered</a> strabismus (when your eyes don’t line up&nbsp;correctly) to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;attractive feature.</strong> In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;develop it&nbsp;intentionally, a&nbsp;rubber ball was hung at&nbsp;the level of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s eyes. In&nbsp;addition, the Maya deliberately deformed the frontal bone of&nbsp;the skull, giving it&nbsp;a&nbsp;flattened shape. To&nbsp;get this, a&nbsp;wooden plank was tightly attached to&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby’s forehead 5&nbsp;days after birth.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the Mayans, this elongated shape of&nbsp;the head made a&nbsp;person look noble. Moreover, this forehead shape made it&nbsp;more convenient to&nbsp;attach straps that helped people carry heavy things. Also, noble people artificially changed the shape of&nbsp;their nose, creating the eagle-like look (sometimes with the help of&nbsp;clay or&nbsp;wax pads).</p><p><h2>What the Mayan understanding of&nbsp;beauty was all about and why they wanted to&nbsp;look like corn</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fd/d3f/dc205556088b24aaf0cc4e09b0.jpg><p>The <a href=#>ideal</a> beauty of&nbsp;those times included approximately the following: a&nbsp;narrow face with prominent cheekbones, an&nbsp;extended backward and markedly flattened forehead, elongated and preferably slanting eyes, a&nbsp;large nose bent downward, a&nbsp;small mouth, and a&nbsp;protruding rounded chin. According to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the theories,<strong> it&nbsp;made the face look like an&nbsp;ear of&nbsp;corn&nbsp;— the main crop cultivated by&nbsp;the Mayans.</strong></p><p>As&nbsp;for the physique, noble people (both men and women) were usually depicted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rather <a href=#>plump</a> way with a&nbsp;noticeable tummy. <strong>Chubbiness was probably considered a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;wealth and prosperity.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d5/ddf/d4d23e594c9cf71ea3fc4ba1a4.jpg><p>The Mayans had a&nbsp;widely spread custom of&nbsp;covering the face and body with geometrical <a href=#>tattoos</a>, for which their pre-painted skin was slightly incised. The more tattoos there were on&nbsp;the body, the braver the man was believed to&nbsp;be, because applying the pattern with incisions was very painful and the person would be&nbsp;sick for several days after this procedure.</p><p><h2>Interesting facts about the Mayans that you won’t be&nbsp;told in&nbsp;history lessons</h2></p><ul readability=-0.48785425101215><li readability=1.9514170040486><p>Actually, the Mayans haven’t disappeared&nbsp;— <strong>there are about 7&nbsp;million of&nbsp;these people’s descendants <a href=#>living</a> in&nbsp;the world today</strong>. Some of&nbsp;them are still involved in&nbsp;producing textiles using technologies that are several thousand years old.</p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b0/390/062ace552eb1c910af5f49e5c5.jpg><ul><li>The Mayans were the only Native American civilization that <a href=#>mastered</a> sea navigation. For that, they used dugout canoes of&nbsp;various sizes and could cover thousands of&nbsp;miles in&nbsp;them. There are pieces of&nbsp;evidence that the Mayans were even able to&nbsp;reach the waters of&nbsp;the Pacific Ocean.</li><li><strong>The Mayan calendar <a href=#>didn’t predict</a> the end of&nbsp;the world in&nbsp;2012</strong>. Authoritative astronomers and experts from other fields declared this point of&nbsp;view to&nbsp;be&nbsp;pseudoscientific because, in&nbsp;their opinion, the supporters of&nbsp;this theory only wanted to&nbsp;earn some good money. In&nbsp;reality, the Mayan calendar depicted the end of&nbsp;one era and the start of&nbsp;another one.</li><li>Thanks to&nbsp;their outstanding achievements, Mayan sacrificers could <a href=#>calculate</a> the dates of&nbsp;solar and lunar eclipses and they presented this as&nbsp;the ability they had to&nbsp;control nature and as&nbsp;proof of&nbsp;their immense power, to&nbsp;simple people.</li></ul><p><h2>Why the Mayan civilization ceased to&nbsp;exist</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c3/143/63747f5160a2ec8e3e86411838.jpg><p><strong>The lack of&nbsp;a&nbsp;single centralized state and intensified destructive wars,</strong> connected with a&nbsp;fight for the throne, were the main reasons for the weakening of&nbsp;their power.</p><p>Moreover, the drought that was the <a href=#>cause</a> of&nbsp;hunger and the decrease of&nbsp;the population also contributed to&nbsp;the downfall of&nbsp;the Mayan civilization. Willing to&nbsp;change their situation, the rulers increased the number of&nbsp;sacrifices, but it&nbsp;didn’t help much. Simple people, in&nbsp;their turn, started to&nbsp;doubt the all-mightiness of&nbsp;their rulers. This is&nbsp;how the pendulum of&nbsp;the great civilization’s downfall started to&nbsp;move.</p><p>According to&nbsp;historical theory, when world empires disintegrate, their civilization often becomes a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;stronger neighbor’s state or&nbsp;falls under this neighbor’s influence.</p><p>Mayan history still attracts the attention of&nbsp;scientists, archaeologists, and cultural figures, while travelers from around the world literally dream of&nbsp;taking a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;the homeland of&nbsp;these people. The Mayans had a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;achievements that other ancient civilizations could only dream about. And as&nbsp;surprising as&nbsp;it&nbsp;might sound, not all of&nbsp;their sites have been discovered and studied. Many of&nbsp;them still remain lost in&nbsp;thick jungles, waiting for their time to&nbsp;shine.</p><p>Would you be&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;starting your trip to&nbsp;the pyramid of&nbsp;Kukulcan right now?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9xecWamq2rXZavsMHTZquhnV2irrqtzWannqegobJuwMeaq2axn6q%2Fbr%2FCoaaopF2psqKvx56prGWUnrGvwIytnKWkXa68tnnAm6aurF1shnmDj3Fm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
