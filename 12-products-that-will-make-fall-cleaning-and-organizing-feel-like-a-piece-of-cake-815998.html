And we&nbsp;gathered 12&nbsp;cleaning and organization products to&nbsp;make your life so&nbsp;much more convenient.</p><h2>1. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>A&nbsp;dishwasher cleaner</a> that magically removes hard stains, grease, and limescale. It&nbsp;removes unpleasant and annoying odors and leaves a&nbsp;fresher smell behind. It&nbsp;also helps prevent spots and dries from appearing on&nbsp;your dishes.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c6/7fb/0d4a225f37b908bd86e142c881.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;recommended to&nbsp;use this once a&nbsp;month or&nbsp;even sooner if&nbsp;you start noticing limescale. You just remove the sticker, place the bottle upside down and run in&nbsp;an&nbsp;empty dishwasher in&nbsp;the hottest setting. The minimum temperature should be&nbsp;at&nbsp;125oF.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>I’m in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rental and the dishwasher was very old and dirty. I&nbsp;took it&nbsp;apart and scrubbed every inch but there was still a&nbsp;bad smell, especially when it&nbsp;first started a&nbsp;clean cycle. Finally discovered this product and ran it&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;empty load on&nbsp;<a href=# title=pots data-link=tag>pots</a> and pans and high heat cycle. When it&nbsp;finished, it&nbsp;smelled so&nbsp;fresh and there was a&nbsp;fizzing sound.</i><br><i>So, I&nbsp;let the dishwasher sit empty for several hours until it&nbsp;stopped fizzing. Then I&nbsp;ran another empty load to&nbsp;rinse. What unbelievable results!! Dishes are so&nbsp;much cleaner, everything smells great, like a&nbsp;brand new dishwasher!! Would absolutely recommend!!</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@rwh</a></li></ul><h2>2. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Magnetic spice jars</a> you can easily place on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;your fridge. They are perfect for small kitchens and the package also comes with spice labels. The metal lids will stick on&nbsp;your fridge nicely and the strong magnets will make sure that they won’t slide.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b52/053/9bc936565d95c3659cf8ab4531.png><p>The set includes 216 washable spice label stickers that can be&nbsp;placed on&nbsp;the lids or&nbsp;the glass bottoms. You can choose the number and size of&nbsp;the jars. You can also choose to&nbsp;buy the jars pre-filled with a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;spices.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>I&nbsp;love these! They’re super cute! One thing&nbsp;I noticed that it&nbsp;worth noting for your purchase is&nbsp;that on&nbsp;“older” fridges with a&nbsp;dimpled texture they sometimes slip a&nbsp;little and occasionally fall when the fridge closed. We&nbsp;replaced our fridge anyways with a&nbsp;smooth surfaced one and have had no&nbsp;problems at&nbsp;all!</i><br><i>I&nbsp;know they also sell a&nbsp;metal plate you can hang on&nbsp;the wall, so&nbsp;if&nbsp;the dimple fridge isn’t working, that plate would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great option! I&nbsp;do plan to&nbsp;buy another set because they look adorable and keep them up&nbsp;and out of&nbsp;the way. They definitely keep the spices dry and fresh which is&nbsp;great!</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Disgruntled Pelican</a></li></ul><h2>3. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>A&nbsp;soap dispensing dish brush</a>, which you can fill with soap and make washing dishes much simpler. You just push the button and the brush releases soap. The scraper of&nbsp;the brush will scrub off hard stains and then make your dishes shine.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c1/07d/a7218552179196304cb2816585.jpg><p>The bristles of&nbsp;the brush are made of&nbsp;nylon, which makes them very durable. They are perfectly safe to&nbsp;use on&nbsp;non-stick cookware. The brush is&nbsp;very easy to&nbsp;refill and the non-slip handle will make it&nbsp;extra easy to&nbsp;wash the dishes.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>This is&nbsp;SO wonderful! It&nbsp;puts out just the right amount of&nbsp;<a href=# title=soap data-link=tag>soap</a>. The brush is&nbsp;sturdy. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;some dishes that&nbsp;I don’t put through the dishwasher, this is&nbsp;also wonderful for cleaning off the <a href=# title=sink data-link=tag>sink</a> mat&nbsp;— both sides! The only problem&nbsp;I have ... I&nbsp;forget to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it!</i><br><i>My&nbsp;son has one similar (not as&nbsp;nice!) and he&nbsp;mentioned it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;smaller size, also, for cleaning inside of&nbsp;<a href=# title=drinking data-link=tag>drinking</a> glasses. I&nbsp;agree. This size is&nbsp;really good for cleaning off cookie sheets, big bowls that don’t go&nbsp;in&nbsp;dishwasher, and so&nbsp;many other things. I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;glad&nbsp;I ordered&nbsp;it!</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Valerie E</a></li></ul><h2>4. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Eraser sponges</a> that can be&nbsp;used on&nbsp;any surface and deliver deep cleaning. They are large and will last you for a&nbsp;while. The sponges include a&nbsp;cleaning powder that gets activated the moment you add water. This means that you don’t need to&nbsp;keep using any strong chemicals.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed8/db5/8c937b5731a2375bff19d8500b.jpg><p>These sponges cut through grease, soap scum and “permanent” marks. You can successfully use them in&nbsp;your <a href=# title=kitchen data-link=tag>kitchen</a>, bathroom, walls, doors, floors, shower, <a href=# title=car data-link=tag>car</a>, toilet, sink, and more. Simply wet with <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a>, squeeze and wipe, letting the eraser do&nbsp;the work.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>These Melemine eracers are SO&nbsp;MUCH BETTER than any other that I’ve tried. So&nbsp;much more durable! So&nbsp;much thicker! Often I&nbsp;end up&nbsp;cutting them in&nbsp;half and they still last so&nbsp;long! If&nbsp;I&nbsp;want a&nbsp;little extra clean I&nbsp;What them and rub them on&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular bar of&nbsp;white soap. Just a&nbsp;little bit and it&nbsp;cleans amazingly well. Great for cleaning sneakers. Especially the white sole.</i><br><i>When I&nbsp;want a&nbsp;little more clean&nbsp;I will wet and rub on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bar of&nbsp;LAVA soap. Some people like to&nbsp;add dish soap but&nbsp;I find that it’s too sudsy and&nbsp;I feel like&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;clean up&nbsp;AFTER cleaning&nbsp;up. Then there are times when&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;clean off electronic things like wires, the metal parts of&nbsp;plugs. I&nbsp;UNPLUG FIRST from ELECTRICITY then&nbsp;I use rubbing alcohol instead of&nbsp;water to&nbsp;get them wet and it&nbsp;works just as&nbsp;well and&nbsp;I don’t have to&nbsp;worry about rusting anything and it&nbsp;dries really quickly!</i><br><i>I&nbsp;don’t use them for&nbsp;<a href=# title=TV data-link=tag>TV</a>, computer, tablet or&nbsp;phone screens. I&nbsp;found that with alcohol it&nbsp;almost makes them too clean if&nbsp;that makes sense.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@RAJ</a></li></ul><h2>5. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>A&nbsp;roll-up dish drying rack</a> that better optimizes your kitchen space. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;very solid and sturdy and will not rust even after years of&nbsp;use. It&nbsp;also features anti-slippery rubber grips at&nbsp;the sides so&nbsp;it&nbsp;can stay in&nbsp;place on&nbsp;your stainless steel sink.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aed/1b8/1a168651d08a0f83197884b1c1.jpg><p>This isn’t only good for drying dishes, but also for letting fruit and vegetable dry and for creating extra counter <a href=# title=space data-link=tag>space</a>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;highly advised to&nbsp;first measure your sink before ordering this item to&nbsp;make sure it&nbsp;will fit your area nicely. It&nbsp;can resist up&nbsp;to&nbsp;450oF.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>Purchased this for over my&nbsp;bathroom vanity sink because&nbsp;I couldn’t put my&nbsp;flat iron or&nbsp;curling wand on&nbsp;a&nbsp;previously purchased one. This is&nbsp;metal so&nbsp;will take anything. Smaller make up&nbsp;items will fall through but&nbsp;I just lay a&nbsp;towel over it&nbsp;and it&nbsp;works like a&nbsp;charm. Rolls up&nbsp;for easy <a href=# title=storage data-link=tag>storage</a>. I&nbsp;recommended this product and also have one for my&nbsp;kitchen.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@DGHR</a></li></ul><h2>6. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Shoe space saving slots</a> that come in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pack of&nbsp;10&nbsp;and don’t even need assembly. They make storing your shoes a&nbsp;much easier experience and help you fit many more pairs in&nbsp;your wardrobe. You can fit sneakers, golf shoes and even stilettos on&nbsp;these slots.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/04c/091/320a8455baa424371a19baab15.png><p>Keep in&nbsp;mind that these slots are not adjustable and work great for smaller size shoes. For example, if&nbsp;your shoe number is&nbsp;9&nbsp;or bigger, your shoes might not fit perfectly in&nbsp;the slots. They can be&nbsp;used on&nbsp;closet shelves, in&nbsp;cabinets, on&nbsp;shoe racks and even on&nbsp;the floor.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>After an&nbsp;extreme cleaning of&nbsp;my&nbsp;closet and getting rid of&nbsp;20&nbsp;pairs of&nbsp;shoes, I&nbsp;bought 40&nbsp;of&nbsp;these shoe slotz to&nbsp;organize my&nbsp;shoe collection and create some space in&nbsp;my&nbsp;closet. The shoe slotz worked great for my&nbsp;flats, my&nbsp;tennis shoes and my&nbsp;low and mid heels. My&nbsp;higher heels didn’t work, but that was because my&nbsp;shelves weren’t tall enough.</i><br><i>My&nbsp;only complaint is&nbsp;that the little tab that you insert on&nbsp;the shoe slotz to&nbsp;hold the shoe in&nbsp;place comes out easily- see my&nbsp;video for clarity. Truthfully, you probably only need these on&nbsp;higher heeled shoes that may slide off without the tab.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Candygirl</a></li></ul><h2>7. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Coffee machine cleaning pods</a> that remove stains and dirt while being eco-friendly and non-toxic. They remove all the residue that puts your coffee machine in&nbsp;danger, while increasing its lifespan. You just use a&nbsp;pod and brew a&nbsp;large cycle with it&nbsp;without any coffee, but just water.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/111/189/99a61b559e80132e66730ca9a5.jpg><p>Every package includes 6&nbsp;of&nbsp;these pods and depending on&nbsp;how often you use your coffee machine, they will offer their cleaning purposes for more than 3&nbsp;months. You don’t need to&nbsp;add any soap or&nbsp;detergent, since these pods can be&nbsp;effective on&nbsp;their own.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>So&nbsp;I&nbsp;finally decided to&nbsp;clean the Keurig that’s only used about 8&nbsp;months out of&nbsp;the year and usually for only 1&nbsp;cup a&nbsp;day. Figuring it&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;too bad. To&nbsp;catch the water&nbsp;I used the only cup that would catch all the water on&nbsp;the largest setting, ie&nbsp;the thermos. Started pouring out the water that came out of&nbsp;the Keurig and noticed some shiny inside the thermos.</i><br><i>Realizing the water had some fizz it&nbsp;was cleaning the thermos too! So&nbsp;I&nbsp;poured out over half after a&nbsp;few swirls, then ran the cycle again without the Kcup and the water filled up&nbsp;the thermos. I&nbsp;left it&nbsp;sit for a&nbsp;few minutes, got the bottle brush out and cleaned the top lip and now it’s all shiny. Both the Keurig and the coffee thermos. Double win!</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Christine</a></li></ul><h2>8. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>A&nbsp;space saving drying rack</a> that will prove lifesaving for parents that have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;bottles to&nbsp;wash daily. The rack is&nbsp;quite small and can fit in&nbsp;all counters and it&nbsp;features 9&nbsp;hooks for drying bottles and sippy cups. The bottom tray is&nbsp;removable so&nbsp;that you can get rid of&nbsp;the excess water easily.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14e/3c5/17cdb5592ab017e7b39ab1bdba.jpg><p>The product is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;plastic, comes in&nbsp;white and grey color combo and weighs only 0.97&nbsp;pounds. It&nbsp;can easily be&nbsp;fitted under the cabinets. It’s not only the bottom part that is&nbsp;removable but also the top.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>I&nbsp;have always had a&nbsp;good experience with any OXO product and this one continues the trend. I&nbsp;have 3&nbsp;kids and this makes storage of&nbsp;their bottles much more efficient and less congested on&nbsp;our kitchen counter. Its sleek design allows you to&nbsp;put bottles, parts, etc. and it&nbsp;doesn’t take up&nbsp;any room at&nbsp;all on&nbsp;the countertop. My&nbsp;newborn is&nbsp;2&nbsp;months and my&nbsp;middle is&nbsp;almost 2&nbsp;years old.</i><br><i>So, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;buy two of&nbsp;these just so&nbsp;we&nbsp;can have an&nbsp;ample amount of&nbsp;room for our bottles, parts, and other toddler/baby stuff we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;store and use. Yes, you need to&nbsp;clean it&nbsp;at&nbsp;least once a&nbsp;week just so&nbsp;the water stains don’t stay&nbsp;on. I&nbsp;usually just clean it&nbsp;with warm water and dry it&nbsp;off with a&nbsp;paper towel and that has done the trick. I&nbsp;highly recommend this product to&nbsp;everyone!</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Amazon Customer</a></li></ul><h2>9. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>A&nbsp;label maker machine</a> that will help you organize your spaces better.

It&nbsp;also provides a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;free templates, containing texts, tables, symbols, logos, barcodes, QR&nbsp;codes and even images. There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;ink involved in&nbsp;this printer, since it&nbsp;is&nbsp;rechargeable.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>Took under five minutes to&nbsp;figure out printing my&nbsp;first label. Fast Bluetooth connection and print time. There are a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;options to&nbsp;print front fonts and sizes to&nbsp;pictures.</i><br><i>The downsides are that real life pictures don’t appear well or&nbsp;detailed enough to&nbsp;look appealing on&nbsp;a&nbsp;label. I&nbsp;also find the app confusing with customization settings, but it’s very easy to&nbsp;use with typing out what you want printed.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Michael</a></li></ul><h2>10. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Vacuum storage bags</a> that can store coats, blankets, bedding and comforters and save up&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;your space.

These bags are heavy duty, durable, puncture resistant, and reusable. A&nbsp;free hand pump comes with the package, but you can also use your vacuum.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>I&nbsp;ordered two packages, 1&nbsp;with 6&nbsp;jumbo bags and 1&nbsp;with 1&nbsp;small, 1&nbsp;medium, 1&nbsp;large and 1&nbsp;jumbo. I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;happy and exited with this purchase, first because the bags looks of&nbsp;very good quality, easy to&nbsp;use and second, I&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;townhouse and by&nbsp;using the bags&nbsp;I saved a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;space putting away all my&nbsp;comforters, blankets, bed sheets, winter jackets, scarves, and gloves.</i><br><i>Only a&nbsp;little issue was that after three days of&nbsp;packaging the staff, two of&nbsp;the jumbo bags were full of&nbsp;air again. Maybe they were damaged. The bags came with an&nbsp;air pump but they didn’t work for&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;used the vacuum and it&nbsp;worked perfectly, so&nbsp;easy and very fast!</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Amazon Customer</a></li></ul><h2>11. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>A&nbsp;fireplace cleaner</a> and a&nbsp;brush that can make any brick, stone, rock, tile, and marble surface shine.

To&nbsp;rinse, spray the surface with water and wipe it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;terry-cloth rag or&nbsp;a&nbsp;microfiber cloth. You don’t need to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;mask or&nbsp;gloves while using it&nbsp;as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;gentle enough and won’t cause any harm.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>Wasn’t sure how this would work.

I&nbsp;purposely let my&nbsp;toilet bowl get grimy to&nbsp;test these cleaner strips. The aroma is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mild pleasant wildflower potpourri type. Each sheet is&nbsp;about 4.38 inches by&nbsp;2.63 inches and&nbsp;I found a&nbsp;half sheet was good enough for my&nbsp;needs.
