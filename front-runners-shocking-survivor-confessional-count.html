However, one way to be prepared for these moments is looking at the numbers of Confessionals that player has throughout the season. These Confessionals have been a constant presence throughout the show’s history, including the current season, </strong><strong>Island of the Idols.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtZ9mx0upRU</p>A “showmance” could create distractions and paint a target on two castaways’ backs. Also, after a visit with Boston Rob and Sandra on Island of the Idols, one castaway has a chance to seize an opportunity to prove their power of persuasion, on Survivor: Island of the Idols, Wednesday, at 8/7c. Only CBS</figure><p>In case the word Confessionals is new to you, its when players explain their&nbsp;feelings&nbsp;on certain players, events,&nbsp;and strategies directly to the audience. Later in the season, players will tend to have more Confessionals because their are less people playing. Early on in the season, it’s eye-opening to see who is given that precious time to explain their game. So, now that three episodes have passed, let’s look at the amount of Confessionals each player has had thus far, on <a href=#>Survivor: Island of the Idols.</a></p><p>NOTE: Elizabeth, Kellee and Vince all visited the Island of the Idols once, adding to their amount of Confessionals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Survivor Episode 1 : I Vote You Out And That’s It</h2><p>Elizabeth had the most Confessionals in the premiere of Island of the Idols, at ten. Elaine and Molly both had a large number as well, with seven and four respectively. Aaron, Janet, Kellee, Missy, and Vince each had three Confessionals; Jack, Jason, Karishma, Tom and Tommy each had two. With one Confessional, Chelsea, Dan, Jamal, Lauren, Noura and Ronnie each made their voices heard, which is better than Dean, who had none.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>Ronnie is blindsided with one Confessional to his name.</figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Survivor Episode 2 : YOLO, Let’s Play!</h3><p>The player with the most Confessionals was Kellee, with nine. Jason and Tommy each had three, while Aaron, Chelsea, Molly and Noura had two. Players with one Confessional were Jack, Jamal, Lauren, Missy, Tom and Vince. Lastly, Dan, Dean, Elaine, Elizabeth, Janet and Karishma did not have any Confessionals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>After a strong first episode, Molly was shockingly voted out in episode two.</figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Survivor Episode 3 : Honestly, Would Be Chill</h3><p>In a <a href=#>Survivor</a> rarity, eliminated player Vince had the most Confessionals, matching Elizabeth’s first episode total of ten. Karishma also had a stand-out episode, with four Confessionals to her name. Jamal had three Confessionals, while Aaron, Elizabeth, Missy and Tommy had two. Dean had his first, and thus far only, Confessional of the season. Also in the one Confessional club were Chelsea, Dan, Jack, Janet, Jason and Tom. Finally, Elaine, Kellee, Lauren, and Noura all had no Confessionals on this episode of Island of the Idols.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr6C0X-ewg0</p>Even with the most Confessionals, Vince wasn’t safe from being voted out in episode three.</figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Front-Runners on Island of the Idols?</h3><p>A high number of Confessionals doesn’t always indicate a winner, as Vince’s elimination in episode three proves. Typically, players with a consistent number of Confessionals tend to be the ones who last the longest. As such, the four players that seem to be early front-runners are <strong>Tommy, Jamal, Chelsea, and Missy.</strong> Each has received at least one Confessional in all three episodes, almost all of which have been game related. Other contenders could include <strong>Lauren and Kellee. </strong>And while it’s hard to rule anyone out of a win this early, <strong>Dean </strong>currently seems like the least likely winner.</p><p><strong>Who do you think has the best chance of winning Island of the Idols?
