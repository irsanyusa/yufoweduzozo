Boogie Storm</h2><p>In Season 10 of Britain’s Got Talent, this dance group, dressed as Stormtroopers, put on an impressive routine complete with flips. Simon Cowell loved it so much, he hit the Golden Buzzer. The group later returned for BGT: The Champions and AGT: The Champions, where they received another Golden Buzzer from Cowell, <a href=# class=broken_link>who stole it</a> from fellow judge Howie Mandel.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Nabil Abdulrashid</h2><p>In Season 14, this stand-up comedian made the audience laugh with jokes about his experience as a Muslim man. Judge Alesha Dixon especially got a kick out of his routine, and she decided to press the Golden Buzzer for him in an emotional moment. She called him “edgy” and “charismatic.” Nabil went on to make it to the Final.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8.

Sarah Ikumu</h2><p>This singer was only 15 years old when she auditioned for Season 11 with a cover of “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” from Dreamgirls.

Sarah ended up making it to the Final.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq_SKMnVZEQ</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6.

Paddy and Nicko made it to the Final, and they later returned for BGT: The Champions, earning another Golden Buzzer from David Walliams.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Twist and Pulse</h2><p>This dance duo were runners-up in Season 4 of Britain’s Got Talent.

Jon Courtenay</h2><p>In Season 14, this funny pianist auditioned with an original song about his experience chasing his dreams, and how his sons encouraged him.

Jon ended up winning the entire competition with his lovable act.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Calum Scott</h2><p>In Season 9 of Britain’s Got Talent, this singer proved that you don’t have to win the show to go far.
