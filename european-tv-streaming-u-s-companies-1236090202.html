On the TV front, about one in four private European TV channels are owned by an American company, the majority of which operate on a multinational level.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">And if we’re giving out medals for TV portfolios, then the U.S. sweeps, thanks to Warner Bros. Discovery (363 channels), Paramount (302) and Comcast (179), which collectively own 58% of the channels of the top 10 European TV players.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On the streaming side, 8 out of the 10 largest portfolios are from Europe-based companies, but WBD is tied for first place with Comcast, at 61 VOD services (including SVOD) each. Those two companies alone make up over a third of the total VOD services in the top 10.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Vivendi, the French mass-media company that owns the also-massive film and TV conglomerate Canal+ Group, takes the silver for VOD by a wide margin from its European counterparts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Zooming out to what the report describes as Europe’s TV and VOD “main players” shows an even greater non-European presence. In terms of combined TV and VOD market share across the continent, major U.S. brands such as WBD, The Walt Disney Company and Netflix, along with Japan’s Rakuten and China’s Huawei, have shut out all European companies from the top 10.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With TV and VOD presence in 46 markets, along with its sizable portfolio, Warner Bros. Discovery handily reigns supreme in Europe. Many of WBD’s major TV and VOD offerings in Europe are the same as the States — Discovery+, CNN, HBO Max and the like — with the game-changer being the coveted pan-European Olympics broadcast rights, which has allowed WBD to air the Games on its own Eurosport network since 2018.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">WBD is at the tail end of that original <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>$1.4 billion deal</a> with the International Olympic Committee, and its new agreement gives free-to-air TV rights to the European Broadcasting Union. But with full streaming and pay TV rights to the Olympics secured through 2032, WBD will still be the access point for the Games for a good number of Europeans.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">That said, WBD’s gold status in Europe isn’t ironclad. The company’s increasingly ugly breakup with the NBA stateside shows the importance of sports in WBD’s arsenal and demonstrates the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>ripple effect</a> a loss like this can cause.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The feud with the NBA is just the latest misfortune for WBD following <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>mass layoffs</a> earlier in July and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>price hikes for Max</a> in June, but it’s yet to be seen if its abundant assets in Europe will help the company weather the storm or go down with it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Still, while traditional U.S. media companies leveraged their strong TV presence to break into VOD, Netflix and Amazon (tied for third at 41 markets each) are dominating just from streaming — yet another example of streaming encroaching on TV’s one-unchallenged territory.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Netflix not only sports <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>solid subscriber numbers</a> in Europe, but the streaming giant has also spent big <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>on international content</a> in its push for more <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>original franchises</a>, to the point of even impacting Hollywood’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ability to rebound</a> post-peak TV.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another big spend for both Amazon and Netflix has been in the world of sports rights, with the former being part of the NBA’s new agreement and the latter bringing WWE and the NFL into the fold. As live sports drift away from cable TV in the U.S., it may only be a matter of time before the streamers start looking at European sports rights.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Unsurprisingly, streaming is big business in Europe. A recent Bango report found that 70% of those surveyed across Europe had an SVOD subscription, easily outpacing all other subscription types. But not only does Europe on average spend less than the U.S. on subscriptions — €696 ($752.58) to the U.S.’ €863 ($933.66) — 42% of respondents have also canceled a subscription due to price jumps.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">But as a potential silver lining to the generalists including WBD, over half of those asked would be loyal to a brand with an all-in-one subscription bundle, and 38% would even be willing to pay more for a more comprehensive entertainment bundle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BrtrF7xK6pqKiVlrtuwNVmqq2qlZa6qrrGZqxmq12YvK68wKegnqtdZn90go9yZ2toYmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
