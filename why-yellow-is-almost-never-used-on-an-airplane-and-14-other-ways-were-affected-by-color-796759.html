<span class=val><a href=./categories/blog>blog</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>Why Yellow Is Almost Never Used On An Airplane, and 14 Other Ways Were Affected by Color</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>We&nbsp;make up&nbsp;our minds about people and products we&nbsp;first see within 90&nbsp;seconds, and about&nbsp;62% to&nbsp;90% of&nbsp;our opinion is&nbsp;<a href=#>based</a> on&nbsp;color alone. That is&nbsp;why some companies use colors in&nbsp;their packaging, logos, and stores to&nbsp;influence our daily decisions. But colors can sometimes play on&nbsp;our psychology even more, like how the colors <a href=# title=pink data-link=tag>pink</a> and blue have been <a href=#>shown</a> to&nbsp;calm&nbsp;us down enough to&nbsp;reduce aggression and suicide.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> hope that you will be&nbsp;tickled pink to&nbsp;learn about how colors play such a&nbsp;great role in&nbsp;our lives.</p><p><h2>1. Pink was for boys, and blue was for girls.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66f/7fe/fa28ac5a9da3f8f6c20c0f23a0.jpg><p><a href=# title=Gender data-link=tag>Gender</a> reveal videos often show pink to&nbsp;signify a&nbsp;baby girl and blue to&nbsp;indicate a&nbsp;baby boy. But a&nbsp;long time ago, babies wore white clothes and no&nbsp;colors were actually linked to&nbsp;gender until some magazines <a href=#>claimed</a> that pink should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy’s color and blue should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl’s color. The trend somehow <a href=#>switched</a> in&nbsp;the 1940s and 1950s to&nbsp;become what we’re used to&nbsp;today.</p><p><h2>2. Pink may be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;calm&nbsp;us down and reduce our aggression.</h2></p><p>Believe it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, some prisons are painted pink to&nbsp;reduce aggression and some locker rooms, meant for the away teams, are also painted pink to&nbsp;make them feel weak. This is&nbsp;because some studies have found Baker-Miller pink to&nbsp;be&nbsp;effective in&nbsp;<a href=#>reducing aggression</a> and <a href=#>strength</a>. However, later research studies done on&nbsp;the same topic <a href=#>found</a> limitations and different outcomes.</p><p><h2>3. Yellow inside an&nbsp;airplane can make our eyes tired.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ce/b69/0a5e725358a52bc28c295dc47a.jpg><p>While yellow is&nbsp;a&nbsp;color that evokes <a href=#>happiness</a>, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;such a&nbsp;bright color that it&nbsp;reflects more light and hence could <a href=#>stimulate</a> the eyes too much. This might explain why most vehicles, especially airplanes, hardly ever use yellow in&nbsp;their interior. Ryanair, a&nbsp;budget airline used to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;yellow, but chose to&nbsp;<a href=#>redo</a> the color of&nbsp;their cabins to&nbsp;the delight of&nbsp;their customers.</p><p><h2>4. When we&nbsp;see red, we&nbsp;snack less.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/436/6fb/74e456535ea953818184e8f651.jpg><p>Contrary to&nbsp;popular belief, the color red does not actually rev up&nbsp;our appetite. This myth has probably appeared because most fast food logos happen to&nbsp;be&nbsp;red. In&nbsp;fact, red has been shown to&nbsp;make people eat <a href=#>less</a> food and consume fewer soft drinks. So&nbsp;red actually works as&nbsp;a&nbsp;subtle stop signal.</p><p><h2>5. We&nbsp;might do&nbsp;things quicker when we&nbsp;see red.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a0d/ae5/a835df5397bbbc1078d93b435b.jpg><p>HubSpot did a&nbsp;test to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;the red or&nbsp;the green button would make people click more and <a href=#>found</a> that the red button outperformed the green button by&nbsp;21%. Perhaps this is&nbsp;why Netflix only uses red buttons for actions that will bring in&nbsp;more customers. Another experiment was done to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;people are affected by&nbsp;the color of&nbsp;the car that blocks their way. The results showed that if&nbsp;the blocking car was red, people gave an&nbsp;aggressive response much <a href=#>quicker</a>.</p><p><h2>6. We’re more likely to&nbsp;trust companies with blue logos.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e69/01a/88b5235313a6025b5c5d81381e.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you have noticed that the logos for credit cards, insurance, and computer companies are often blue, you are right. Blue gives off a&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;security, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;are more likely to&nbsp;find companies <a href=#>reliable</a> if&nbsp;they use more blue in&nbsp;their logos or&nbsp;products.</p><p><h2>7. Blue may be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;save our lives and reduce crime.</h2></p><p>Blue goes even further because it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;<a href=#>able</a> to&nbsp;help&nbsp;us choose life over death. Some train stations in&nbsp;Japan have installed blue lights in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;prevent people from jumping on&nbsp;the tracks to&nbsp;commit suicide.</p><p><h2>8. Color-coded labels can make&nbsp;us choose healthier food.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e2/f48/3c7fa0568999bf493462a3b19d.jpg><p>Colors may also be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;help&nbsp;us change our diets. A&nbsp;cafeteria <a href=#>intervention</a> was done in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hospital where the foods being sold were labeled green for “healthy” and red for “unhealthy.” The test concluded that color-coding our food can assist&nbsp;us in&nbsp;improving our food choices. A&nbsp;more recent <a href=#>study</a> done by&nbsp;using the traffic-light system to&nbsp;also include yellow, to&nbsp;label “less healthy” foods, also showed better food choices.</p><p><h2>9. Men and women see colors differently.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4d/f18/f836765e31aad51be8e8d15cb4.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you can remember the <a href=#>debate</a> of&nbsp;the blue/black versus white/gold dress, it&nbsp;feels crazy that people can see the same colors differently. But the truth&nbsp;is, everyone does see colors differently and there is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;<a href=#>difference</a> between how men and women see colors. Men are better at&nbsp;detecting fine details that change quickly from afar, while women are better at&nbsp;distinguishing shades of&nbsp;a&nbsp;color.</p><p><h2>10. Orange makes&nbsp;us think of&nbsp;good value.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f1c/14c/fad0a55b1b923d5304d27323a0.jpg><p>The color orange stands out, which is&nbsp;why it&nbsp;is&nbsp;usually used in&nbsp;<a href=#>traffic cones</a> and prison uniforms. But the color also makes&nbsp;us think of&nbsp;fun and entertainment, like the shades used by&nbsp;<a href=#>Nickelodeon</a> and Fanta. We&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;associate the color with <a href=#>value</a> for money as&nbsp;well. Home Depot and Jetstar did the right thing by&nbsp;making their memorable branding orange.</p><p><h2>11. Green can boost our visual creativity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2a/061/06bfc55f8b98d5d7d0c0ffe8f5.jpg><p>It’s not unusual to&nbsp;hear people saying that we&nbsp;should have plants at&nbsp;our workplace, but it&nbsp;turns out that even a&nbsp;green wall and green paper can have a&nbsp;<a href=#>positive impact</a> on&nbsp;us. Although green may not help in&nbsp;verbal creativity (for example when we’re writing a&nbsp;storybook), it&nbsp;may enhance our <a href=#>visual creativity</a>. This is&nbsp;definitely good news for artists, people in&nbsp;the advertising industry, and students who work with visuals!</p><p><h2>12. Ice hockey players who wear black get more penalties.</h2></p><p>Teams who wear black jerseys when playing ice hockey get more and longer penalties than teams who don other colors. Some say that this means people tend to&nbsp;feel more powerful and be&nbsp;more <a href=#>aggressive</a> when they wear black. But there are researchers who’ve argued that it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;that referees are more <a href=#>biased</a> against the color black.</p><p><h2>13. Color can trick&nbsp;us when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;temperature and weight.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03d/b79/8276875bd18a66777a5e6e577a.jpg><p>Red is&nbsp;often seen as&nbsp;hot and blue as&nbsp;cold, even if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;difference whatsoever in&nbsp;the actual <a href=#>temperature</a>. Surprisingly, when <a href=#>direct touch</a> is&nbsp;involved, a&nbsp;blue object is&nbsp;judged to&nbsp;be&nbsp;warmer than a&nbsp;red object. Colors also give an&nbsp;illusion to&nbsp;the weight of&nbsp;an&nbsp;object, where the exact same object with the same <a href=#>weight</a> can look heavier if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;painted red and lighter if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;yellow.</p><p><h2>14. We&nbsp;make more errors when we&nbsp;work in&nbsp;a&nbsp;white office.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90a/8f2/f9037f526198e263188ebdc238.jpg><p>It&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;make sense that white gives off a&nbsp;fresh, non-distracting feeling, which is&nbsp;why some offices have white interiors. However, a&nbsp;study found that people in&nbsp;white offices made the <a href=#>most errors</a>, compared to&nbsp;those in&nbsp;a&nbsp;red or&nbsp;green office. In&nbsp;fact, those working in&nbsp;the red office made the fewest errors even though more reported that the color of&nbsp;their room was more distracting than those in&nbsp;the white office.</p><p><h2>15. We&nbsp;see purple as&nbsp;luxury because it&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;expensive.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d1d/2e0/2c6dac5b7487a6a1dbaf13b28d.jpg><p>Purple fabric used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ridiculously <a href=#>expensive</a> because the process of&nbsp;making the dye from tiny shellfish was long and difficult. Only rulers and priests could afford to&nbsp;wear purple then. Luckily, an&nbsp;18-year-old chemistry student <a href=#>accidentally</a> made a&nbsp;purple dye and later mass-produced it&nbsp;so&nbsp;that even an&nbsp;ordinary person can wear purple.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Did you know?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e05/580/27c2a95145bec89d9440a7b1f5.jpg><p>Color blindness <a href=#>affects</a> 1&nbsp;in&nbsp;12&nbsp;men and 1&nbsp;in&nbsp;200&nbsp;women. While the most common <a href=#>type</a> of&nbsp;color blindness is&nbsp;the difficulty to&nbsp;tell the difference between red and green, there are also blue-yellow color blindness, and complete color blindness.</p><p>Have you ever made decisions based on&nbsp;colors that made you feel regretful or&nbsp;happy afterward?
