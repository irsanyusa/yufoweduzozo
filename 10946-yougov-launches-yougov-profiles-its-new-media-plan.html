This connected data is unique to the research industry and it means YouGov clients can mine its huge seam of information in real-time and understand more about their audiences than ever before.</p><p>The data in <i>YouGov Profiles</i> is updated continuously,<i> </i>allowing brands and agencies to assess consumer behaviour with greater granularity, accuracy, and immediacy than ever before. The information in the tool ranges from demographic and lifestyle data to consumer and brand information (such as where people shop and what type of car they own), which can be analysed against consumers’ complete media consumption. The power of YouGov’s methodology allows it to collect the long tail of personal attributes, including in more niche areas (such as their musical preferences) and more abstract considerations (such as personality type).</p><p>The product’s holistic approach to data helps brands and agencies gain insights in a number of important areas:</p><ul><li><b>Profile advanced segments quickly:</b> Providing more in-depth insight into how different groups of consumers feel towards the brand</li><li><b>Plan more effective advertising campaigns:</b> Analysing media consumption data that is collected daily (as opposed to monthly or quarterly)</li><li><b>Formulate more relevant and targeted communications: </b>Developing propositions and messages that are unique to different segments to maximise cut-through</li></ul><p>Stephan Shakespeare, YouGov Global CEO, says: “The market research industry has had nothing new to say to the creative marketing industry since the invention of the focus group. With <i>YouGov Profiles</i>, we now have a giant range of in-depth, up-to-the-moment, connected data that is reliable for the practical decisions of media management and inspiring for fresh creative angles. By using the 120,000 data variables we have from our panellists we can now construct a three-dimensional portrait of who they are, how they behave and what drives the way they act. This allows <i>YouGov Profiles</i> to already know answers to questions that competing tools have not yet asked and gives brands crucial insights to better understand their customers and competitors. This is a revolutionary product and no other research company can boast the depth and richness of understanding of specific audiences."</p><p>Dare, the new digital agency, is one of the early subscribers to <i>YouGov Profiles</i>. John Owen, chief strategy officer, Dare, says: "Consumer insight is vital to what we do at Dare. We believe <i>YouGov Profiles</i> will help us to routinely deliver a deeper level of insight than has previously been possible with panel-based tools."</p><p><strong>Click here for more information about <a href=#>YouGov Profiles</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWWGdYKMsqaun5%2Breq2t1KeaoZ2jYsawwcaorWaooqSzqrjErGSirKNiu6bDjKacnaGRYr2trc0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
