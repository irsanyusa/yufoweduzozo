<span class=val><a href=./categories/blog>blog</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>11 Times When The Nanny Showed Us What True Style Means</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><i>The Nanny</i> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;series that has not only marked those who watched it&nbsp;between <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1993 and 1999</a> when it&nbsp;aired on&nbsp;CBS. Subsequent generations have also been mesmerized by&nbsp;the show’s witty humor, its characters, and, of&nbsp;course, <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;picture Fran Fine without her most striking and spectacular outfits coming to&nbsp;mind. What few people know is&nbsp;that these outfits worn by&nbsp;a&nbsp;nanny from Flushing, Queens became an&nbsp;inspiration for other designers, and many were from renowned brands.</p><p><h2>1. The designer of&nbsp;the series chose 50&nbsp;outfits per episode.</h2></p><p>Emmy-winning costume designer Brenda Cooper is&nbsp;the one who carefully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>selected</a> Fran’s outfits during the first four seasons of&nbsp;the series. She sought to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;style that, in&nbsp;her own words, “had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fun, witty, sassy, and elegant. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;sassy elegance that was important to&nbsp;me, and pushing that to&nbsp;the edge without tipping&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Cooper would put together about 50&nbsp;outfits per episode for the <a href=#>cast</a>, six of&nbsp;which were for Fran Drescher.</p><p><h2>2. Todd Oldham got to&nbsp;dress Fran Fine many times.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ad/535/7f49ec53edaddb029e5d306b34.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>top designers</a> on&nbsp;the show was Todd Oldham. According to&nbsp;Cooper, he&nbsp;was “a&nbsp;huge influence from the beginning.” Later, they all became friends, and he&nbsp;would offer them some outfits, or, if&nbsp;not, they would buy them.</p><p><h2>3. Certain elements were added to&nbsp;make the nanny’s outfits look fashionable but in&nbsp;tune with her job.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c2/865/f8f0ee541799135a45eead1979.jpg><p>The cocktail dresses we&nbsp;frequently saw on&nbsp;the show weren’t appropriate for a&nbsp;nanny, so&nbsp;Cooper <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;fix that by&nbsp;adding a&nbsp;turtleneck sweater, which became a&nbsp;classic in&nbsp;Fran Fine’s wardrobe.</p><p>“There are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a href=#>cocktail dresses</a> out there, but that isn’t going to&nbsp;work for a&nbsp;nanny. How do&nbsp;I solve that problem? With a&nbsp;turtleneck,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><p><h2>4. C.C. wore a&nbsp;collection of&nbsp;jackets from the 1940s.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb7/07b/183329555694ea0a018a9ba064.jpg><p>Chastity Claire “C.C.” Babcock, Mr. Sheffield’s partner, had a&nbsp;somewhat more <a href=# title=understated data-link=tag>understated</a> style than Fran, and she regularly wore manly jackets, which <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>belonged</a> to&nbsp;Brenda Cooper’s jacket collection from the 1940s.</p><p>“That red jacket was my&nbsp;jacket. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;collection of&nbsp;1940s jackets, and&nbsp;I used to&nbsp;put C.C [Lauren Lane] in&nbsp;all of&nbsp;them. She was a&nbsp;different character. She was town and country, very proper, but she couldn’t be&nbsp;town and country boring,” the designer recounted.</p><p><h2>5. Fran Drescher still keeps some of&nbsp;the garments she wore in&nbsp;the series.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe5/edc/60f3e65bc691473456afd050da.jpg><p>Fran wore the famous multicolored Moschino vest in&nbsp;several <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>episodes</a>. In&nbsp;2021, the actress <a href=#>surprised</a> everyone when she posted a&nbsp;photo on&nbsp;Instagram showing that she had kept the garment. She still wears it&nbsp;and looks spectacular in&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>6. The nanny also wears a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;Versace clothes throughout the series.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/206/9c0/43e52c55738706aafdff611613.jpg><p>Fran Fine wore haute couture brands on&nbsp;multiple occasions, all of&nbsp;them matching her fun and risky style. Versace was one of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>designers</a> that regularly dressed the nanny, and that became part of&nbsp;her iconic style.</p><p><h2>7. They didn’t have much budget for wardrobe at&nbsp;the beginning.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/496/e97/9d08d8556dbeda329f17ca611f.jpg><p>When the show premiered, they didn’t have much budget, so&nbsp;Brenda Cooper managed to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;outfits combining a&nbsp;turtleneck sweater, a&nbsp;black miniskirt, and black tights with black suede heels.</p><p>“The heels had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;suede, so&nbsp;that they didn’t reflect the light. Because if&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been leather, you would have seen the break on&nbsp;camera. I&nbsp;wanted a&nbsp;solid silhouette. Then we’d change the look by&nbsp;the jackets and pieces that are put over&nbsp;it,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><p><h2>8. Fran’s wedding dress cost $12,000.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/7eb/899/670ca85d869487556d923f8826.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;the fifth season, when Fran and Maxwell finally make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the altar, her dress became <a href=#>the center of&nbsp;our attention</a>. This garment was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> by&nbsp;the Argentine designer Norma LeNain, who gave it&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic and feminine style with a&nbsp;voluminous silhouette. The dress had a&nbsp;1.20-meter train and a&nbsp;4.5-meter veil, and it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cost</a> $12,000.</p><p><h2>9. Fran Fine and Madonna wore the same dress.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac9/51d/9f18d05648bc7211a83e3329a0.jpg><p>In&nbsp;February 1991, during a&nbsp;photo shoot for a&nbsp;magazine, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Madonna</a> wore a&nbsp;strapless silver dress completely embroidered with diamonds by&nbsp;designer Bob Mackie. It&nbsp;was valued at&nbsp;more than $25&nbsp;million. The singer loved the garment so&nbsp;much that the designer made a&nbsp;replica for her to&nbsp;wear that same year at&nbsp;the Oscars.</p><p>Later, Fran Drescher <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wore the same</a> dress, or&nbsp;perhaps another replica, by&nbsp;Bob Mackie, who has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dressed</a> other celebrities like <a href=#>Cher</a>, Elton John, RuPaul, and Diana Ross.</p><p><h2>10. The bath robes were customized to&nbsp;match Fran’s style.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a27/260/6ffc0b564f91f3652de70a7675.jpg><p>The robes, which Fran frequently paraded around the house&nbsp;in, were anything but simple&nbsp;— the costume designer added small details to&nbsp;make them more appropriate to&nbsp;Fran’s flamboyant style.</p><p>“Whatever robe we&nbsp;had, my&nbsp;team of&nbsp;seamstresses, who used to&nbsp;work for Bob Mackie, would put shoulder pads in&nbsp;it, and that became the signature robe that people loved,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained Cooper</a>.</p><p><h2>11. Her outfits have been a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;inspiration for others.</h2></p><p>Designer Vero Díaz, from Yucatán, Mexico, found inspiration in&nbsp;<i>The Nanny</i> for her fall-winter collection for the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.</p><p>“The collection is&nbsp;inspired by&nbsp;the 1990s. We&nbsp;took a&nbsp;lot from Fran Fine’s style in&nbsp;the series. I&nbsp;remember when&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;little girl, they used to&nbsp;call me ’nanny Fine’ because&nbsp;I was always shouting. So&nbsp;that brought back fond memories and was a&nbsp;great source of&nbsp;inspiration,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yedOipJ6rXay1prqMrZ%2BeZZ6Wu6%2FFjKyfqK%2BVmXq2v4ywn5qsXam%2FtrGMrKuypJViuqatzaxkcWlhbX1yew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
