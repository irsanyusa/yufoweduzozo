Some appear as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;accidental mutations, and some as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;long and careful work for many generations. Short-fur, bald, yellow-eyes, cats that look like tigers and leopards with curled ears and short legs&nbsp;— breeders can get really creative.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> also love cats and we&nbsp;found some of&nbsp;the most rare, new, and unusual cats that people all around the world own.</p><p><h2>1. American Wirehair</h2></p><p>The fur of&nbsp;<a href=#>these cats</a> looks very wiry (which is&nbsp;why the breed has this name) but in&nbsp;fact, it’s just as&nbsp;soft as&nbsp;other cats’ fur. The cats of&nbsp;this breed are never brushed after washing in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;keep the natural beauty of&nbsp;their fur. American Wirehairs are really curious and obedient and they can easily adapt to&nbsp;change.</p><p><h2>2. Sokoke</h2></p><p>African <a href=#>Sokoke</a> cats look like Cheetahs. They have spots on&nbsp;their bodies, big ears, and they are really active. The breed appeared at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 1970s and became popular throughout Europe very fast. Sokoke cats are independent and not demanding but their owners need to&nbsp;make sure they have enough room to&nbsp;play.</p><p><h2>3. Nebelung</h2></p><p><a href=#>Nebelungs</a> originated from Russian blue cats. Young Nebelungs can be&nbsp;quite aggressive toward guests, but they are really nice to&nbsp;their owners. Another interesting feature of&nbsp;this breed is&nbsp;that they have a&nbsp;really quiet voice.</p><p><h2>4. Minuet</h2></p><p><a href=#>Minuet</a> cats originated from Munchkin cats and Persians. These cats don’t require any specific type of&nbsp;care and their high intelligence and absence of&nbsp;aggression make them ideal pets. They were actually first called Napoleon cats, because they’re so&nbsp;short, like Napoleon Bonaparte.</p><p><h2>5. LaPerm</h2></p><p><a href=#>LaPerms</a> are some of&nbsp;the most unusual cats in&nbsp;this compilation. They are special because their fur is&nbsp;permanently curly.</p><p><h2>6. Chantilly-Tiffany</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>Chantilly-Tiffany</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat has long, silk-like fur in&nbsp;a&nbsp;chocolate color and amber eyes. The cats of&nbsp;this breed are really smart, friendly, and have a&nbsp;great attitude toward children. They don’t need a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;special care, the only thing you need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;take good care of&nbsp;their long fur.</p><p><h2>7. Bombay cat</h2></p><p><a href=#>Bombay cats</a> look like Bagheera from Rudyard Kipling’s Mowgli stories. Despite their name, they were not bred in&nbsp;India but originated in&nbsp;the US. Their look is&nbsp;really impressive: with amber-like yellow eyes and smooth dark fur&nbsp;— they look like black panthers. Their appearance, however, doesn’t stop these cats from being very good house pets.</p><p><h2>8. Foldex cat</h2></p><p><a href=#>Foldex cats</a> look a&nbsp;lot like toys. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;British Shorthair, Scottish Fold, and Persian cats. They have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fur and they are quite friendly. They can’t live without their owners.</p><p><h2>9. American Curl</h2></p><p>The special feature of&nbsp;the cats of&nbsp;<a href=#>this breed</a> are their ears, which are an&nbsp;unusual shape. Curls can have both long fur and short fur, they can be&nbsp;any color, the only thing that matters is&nbsp;that the ears should be&nbsp;curled. Curls are very loyal and communicative cats with great health.</p><p><h2>10. Selkirk Rex</h2></p><p>It’s not only LaPerms that have permanent curly hair. <a href=#>Selkirk Rex</a> cats also have this fur. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;Persian, British, and some exotic breed with a&nbsp;dominant curly fur gene. Selkirk Rex cats look like small bears and they are really loyal and kind. Their fur has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken care of&nbsp;every day, otherwise, there may be&nbsp;problems.</p><p><h2>11. Dwelf</h2></p><p>These <a href=#>cats</a> are a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;Sphynx, Munchkins, and Curls and they have all the usual features of&nbsp;these breeds: a&nbsp;small cat with short legs, curled ears, and no&nbsp;fur. These cats look like magical creatures. Taking care of&nbsp;Dwelf cats is&nbsp;not easy: they love warmth, they need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;washed often, and their eyes, nose, and ears should be&nbsp;cleaned every day.</p><p><h2>12. Singapura cat</h2></p><p><a href=#>Singapura cats</a> are the smallest cats in&nbsp;the world. They have excellent health and they don’t require any special care. Many people get these cats because of&nbsp;their small size.</p><p><h2>13. Lykoi</h2></p><p><a href=#>Lykoi</a> cats are like wolves. They have a&nbsp;unique kind of&nbsp;black fur that looks like a&nbsp;possum’s hair. And the fact that they don’t have any fur on&nbsp;their faces makes them look like werewolves, this is&nbsp;where the name of&nbsp;the breed comes from. However, despite their look, Lykoi cats are very loyal and friendly pets.</p><p><h2>14. Kinkalow</h2></p><p>This <a href=#>combination</a> of&nbsp;Munchkins and American Curls has features from both breeds. Their petite stature and their short legs come from Munchkins and their curled ears come from Curls. At&nbsp;the moment, there are just about 100 Kinkalow cats in&nbsp;the world, but the breed is&nbsp;becoming more and more popular.</p><p><h2>15. Chartreux</h2></p><p>This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the oldest European breeds that were originally bred about 600 years ago. <a href=#>Chartreux</a> cats are huge cats with honey-like eyes, blue fur, and independent personalities. They are good pets, but they can be&nbsp;jealous if&nbsp;you have other animals.</p><p><h2>16. American Ringtail</h2></p><p><a href=#>American Ringtails</a> are a&nbsp;new breed and not everyone is&nbsp;in&nbsp;agreement yet that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;really even a&nbsp;breed. Their tails are curled in&nbsp;the back like Husky’s tales. Ringtails are playful, curious, communicative, and unlike other cats, love water.</p><p>Would you like to&nbsp;get one of&nbsp;these cats? If&nbsp;yes, which one?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH53edGaqZ5lmKTCtLGMnJitZZKnsqaw0maunmWUnrGvwIykpaivXZrFqr%2FTnptmbmZuhHJ8jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
