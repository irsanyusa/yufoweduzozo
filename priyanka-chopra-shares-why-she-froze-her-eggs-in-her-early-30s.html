Last year, Chopra welcomed a baby daughter named Malti via surrogate with her husband Nick Jonas.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-priyanka-chopra-froze-her-eggs-in-her-early-30s>Priyanka Chopra Froze Her Eggs in Her Early 30s</h2><p>Chopra was recently a guest on Dax Shepard’s podcast <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Armchair Expert</a>, where she opened up about her desire to have kids and her decision to have her eggs frozen when she was in her early 30s.</p><p>“I always knew I wanted kids, which was one of the big reasons I didn’t want to date Nick at that time, because I was like, ‘I don’t know if he wants kids at 25,'” Chopra shared. “I love kids. I’ve worked with kids with UNICEF for years, I’ve volunteered in kids’ hospitals, I am like a kid whisperer. I’d rather spend more time with children than with adults.”</p><p>Chopra shared that her mom is an OBGYN who encouraged her to freeze her eggs. She said she’s made the same suggestion to her younger friends, explaining that “the biological clock is real,” making it more difficult to get pregnant and carry to term after the age of 35.</p><p>“I felt such a freedom,” Chopra said of her decision to have her eggs frozen. “I did it in my early thirties. I could continue on an ambitious warpath that I wanted to achieve. I wanted to get to a certain place in my career. And I also hadn’t met the person I wanted to have children with.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NICK JONAS, PRIYANKA CHOPRA MAKE OUT IN TRAILER OF NEW MOVIE ‘LOVE AGAIN’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-copra-welcomed-daughter-malti-in-2022>Copra Welcomed Daughter Malti in 2022</h2><p>In January 2022, Chopra and Jonas welcomed their daughter Malti <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">via surrogate</a>.

As the actress shared, “I’m so grateful I was in a position where I could do this. Our surrogate was so generous, kind, lovely and funny, and she took care of this precious gift for us for six months.”</p><p>Malti <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made her public debut</a> earlier this year during the Jonas Brothers’ Hollywood Walk of Fame induction ceremony. Jonas joked in his speech, “I can’t wait to come here with you in 15 years and embarrass you in front of your friends.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_DylanZangwell_Then_Now-220x147.jpg alt="‘AGT’s Dylan Zangwill Earns ‘American Idol’ Golden Ticket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>nick jonas</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Priyanka Chopra</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57z6ugspmeoK5ur8eop6uZXai1or7ErGSwoKliwKmxjJ%2BpqLKVYrWmvoyenqCrXZ67brTEq2SemaKhxm5%2Fj6xm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
