She has been labeled a&nbsp;“bad mom” and told that her daughter would be&nbsp;embarrassed of&nbsp;her when she grows older. However, Becky strongly believes that her tattoos should not define her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent.</p><p>“I&nbsp;don’t see why having tattoos makes me&nbsp;any less of&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent than somebody who doesn’t have tattoos,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> Becky. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;video, she lovingly dresses her daughter and reflects on&nbsp;her parenting style. She prefers to&nbsp;keep things casual, avoiding the hassle of&nbsp;extravagant outfits for her child.</p><p><h2>Motherhood has brought significant changes to&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/57e/fcd/79bad052ea8a740e40cc0bc284.jpg><p>Becoming a&nbsp;mother has ushered in&nbsp;profound transformations in&nbsp;her life, substituting late-night social gatherings with late-night baby feeds and diaper changes. Weekends have undergone a&nbsp;shift, now centered on&nbsp;enjoyable play dates and gatherings with fellow moms.</p><p>Becky, who began getting tattoos at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;15, speaks passionately about her inked journey. She admits that she has lost count of&nbsp;the total number of&nbsp;tattoos she has but mentions a&nbsp;substantial unfinished piece. Despite the negativity she encounters online and in&nbsp;public, she remains steadfast in&nbsp;her belief that her tattoos <strong>should not affect her role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother</strong>.</p><p><h2>She doesn’t hide her tattoos when she’s with her daughter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b1/ef6/34a35452ecace56af6d96dbacf.jpg><p>She refuses to&nbsp;cover up&nbsp;her tattoos around her daughter, emphasizing that she dresses respectfully as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother but retains her personal style. If&nbsp;her daughter were to&nbsp;face judgment for her mother’s tattoos, Becky would encourage her to&nbsp;ignore&nbsp;it, reminding her that people will judge regardless of&nbsp;the situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6eb/9ba/a10f6f540eaeba0d9d3d7deaa6.jpg><p>Despite the criticism and societal pressures, Becky is&nbsp;not done with tattoos. She mentions her desire to&nbsp;have her tongue split, something she has contemplated for years. However, what stands out most about Becky is&nbsp;her dedication to&nbsp;motherhood. She is&nbsp;an&nbsp;exceptional mother, attentive and caring, and she takes pride in&nbsp;raising her daughter despite the stares and judgments she faces.<br></p><p><h2>She firmly believes that having tattoos does not make her any less of&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent than someone without them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ba6/168/1e3f175fb190dd4036d767064e.png><p>In&nbsp;response to&nbsp;those who question her parenting abilities based on&nbsp;her appearance, Becky has a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>simple message</a>: “Worry about yourself because I’m doing fine. Rory is&nbsp;amazing, and we’re both doing really, really well. I&nbsp;don’t think there are any issues in&nbsp;my&nbsp;parenting skills whatsoever.”</p><p>We&nbsp;also have an&nbsp;article about a&nbsp;<a href=#>heavily tattooed dad</a>, where you’ll discover the challenges he&nbsp;faces as&nbsp;some people mistakenly perceive him as&nbsp;a&nbsp;less capable father due to&nbsp;his extensive body art. However, his commitment to&nbsp;his children and his parenting skills defies these stereotypes, emphasizing that appearances can be&nbsp;deceiving when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;parenting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uw86mmKdlp5bAbq%2FApaOenF2WeqOtw2akqKVdl7KkrdSsnGanlmK1pr6MrZitrJ%2BkwG6u1K1ksKCRqXq0tMRmqpqhlGKwosHSnptmmV2owaq%2BjKilZqyYmnqqutOeqaedpGKFcoGRbG5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
