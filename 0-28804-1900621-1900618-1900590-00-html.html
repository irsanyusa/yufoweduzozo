It's an uphill battle: the man otherwise known as Clark Rockefeller has been passing himself off as a member of the industrialist dynasty for years. And really, that's the least of his worries. After abducting his then 7-year-old daughter Reigh Boss from a Boston street in the summer of 2008, Rockefeller now faces charges of assault and kidnapping as well.</p><p>Rockefeller's lawyers are claiming mental distress caused him to snatch his daughter that day, injuring a social worker in the process; a rough divorce in 2007 had left him limited to just three supervised visits with his child a year. But investigators say that Rockefeller, who was caught in Baltimore after a week on the run, is a person of interest in the 1980s disappearance of a California couple. His trial is set to begin May 26.</p><p class=next-item><span>Next</span> <a href=#>David Hampton</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6PBprrTZ6uipZVjsLC5jq2gpp1fqL2mr8iao6xnoJawrK3GnqpomaKptqS4xGhnZWpobX11eJByZ2luYmascoWPaW1qcI9mhnF8lHJnZWhgY7W1ucs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
