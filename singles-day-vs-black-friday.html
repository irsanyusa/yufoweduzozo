Last year, Singles’ Day hit a record <a href=# rel=noopener>$25.3 billion in sales</a>, double Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But its <a href=#>origins stretch back</a> to 1993, when students at China’s Nanjing University bought presents to celebrate their single-hood and resist social pressure to get married. The single students chose Nov. 11 as their “anti-Valentine’s Day,” with each of the date’s lone digit (11.11) representing a “bare stick,” or uncoupled individual who rides solo.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These days, Singles’ Day is still about treating yourself, whether or not you have someone to share your new loot. It’s also gone global: Alibaba rebranded Singles’ Day as the “11.11 Global Shopping Festival,” and its e-commerce archrival JD.com joined the fray, as have <a href=# rel=noopener>international brands</a> like Gap, Nike, and Macy’s. In 2016, Alibaba even started holding “<a href=# rel=noopener>See Now, Buy Now</a>” fashion shows in late October, extending the Singles’ Day shopping spree with <a href=# rel=noopener>preorder deals</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Let’s unpack some Singles’ Day stats and see how the Chinese shopping sensation stacks up.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Singles’ Day vs. Black Friday</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The main American competitor for Singles Day is post-Thanksgiving Black Friday, known for <a href=#>snaking queues</a> and <a href=#>dangerous stampedes</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Both holidays mark seasons for splurging. Singles’ Day shopping starts between <a href=#>China’s Golden Week</a> (early October) and Chinese New Year (early February), filling an otherwise slow spell for retailers, while Black Friday and digital-era companion <a href=#>Cyber Monday</a> signal the kickoff of winter holiday shopping in the U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But they do have some differences. Singles’ Day features more <a href=# rel=noopener>limited-edition luxury items</a>, with less emphasis on steep discounts.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many U.S. shoppers look to Black Friday to indulge on a big purchase, like a flat-screen TV, at discount prices. But Singles’ Day, like original nemesis Valentine’s Day, has also become known for gift exchanges.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“What started as an occasion for single people to celebrate their independence has evolved into one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>biggest gifting occasions</a> in China,” Fung Global Retail & Technology analysts reported in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gettyimages-872406826.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The numbers</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Going by the statistics, there’s little contest: <a href=# rel=noopener>Singles’ Day sales</a> surged past America’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday in 2012 and only expanded from there. Alibaba hauled in <a href=# rel=noopener>$25.3 billion</a> alone in 2017, compared to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which together, raked in <a href=# rel=noopener>$11.62 billion</a> for Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. And Alibaba isn’t the only player: JD.com also made <a href=# rel=noopener>$19.1 billion</a> on Singles’ Day 2017.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shoppers in <a href=# rel=noopener>225 countries</a> snapped up goods from over 140,000 businesses, according to data from Alibaba. At the height of sales, Alibaba’s cloud services processed 325,000 transactions per second; in total, it delivered <a href=# rel=noopener>812 million packages</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Singles’ Day 2018 promises to be an even bigger bonanza. For Singles’ Day tenth anniversary, Alibaba is extending sales for <a href=# rel=noopener>48 hours</a>, giving shoppers more time to browse <a href=# rel=noopener>500,000 items</a> from 180,000 brands and 75 countries on online outlet Tmall. Alibaba’s subsidiaries will also be offering special deals, including Alibab’s food delivery service Ele.me, supermarket Hema, and Southeast Asian e-commerce site Lazada.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Singles’ Day 2018 will be “<a href=# rel=noopener>bigger and more successful</a>” than its predecessors, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang promised last month.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alibaba is already getting ready: its logistics firm opened China’s <a href=# rel=noopener>largest robotic warehouse</a> and chartered <a href=# rel=noopener>51 international flights</a> and 1,000 shipping containers. Alibaba may need them: the company expects to hit 1 billion orders.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Singles’ Day vs. Prime Day</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s also a recent upstart: <a href=#>Prime Day</a>, which Amazon <a href=#>debuted in July 2015</a> with special deals only for Amazon Prime customers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Amazon doesn’t disclose sales figures, but the company said that Prime Day 2018 was its <a href=# rel=noopener>biggest</a> ever, with 100 million products ordered despite <a href=#>early technical glitches</a>. Amazon also extended Prime Day for 36-hours and <a href=#>offered credit</a> to Whole Foods customers in response.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Prime Day is still a mere minnow compared to Singles’ Day. Part of the reason is market size: Prime Day only caters to Amazon subscribers, whose number surpassed <a href=#>100 million</a> this year. Amazon also uses Prime Day to promote Prime membership and in-house products like <a href=#>Alexa and Echo</a> speakers and <a href=#>Fire tablets</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Singles Day 2018 events</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Singles’ Day is about far more than the sales, with Alibaba and other brands vendors hosting a slew of festivals and special events to entice shoppers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alibaba kicks off Singles’ Day with a star-studded gala on Nov. 10 that rivals the Super Bowl for spectacle. The 2017 telecast was headlined by Pharrell Williams and included virtual reality shows, a <a href=# rel=noopener>free Antarctic excursion</a> giveaway, and celebrity appearances by Nicole Kidman, Jesse J, and Maria Sharapova.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>“Entertainment</a> and interaction are now increasingly becoming a part of e-commerce,” CEO Zhang said last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gettyimages-872691950.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For 2018, Alibaba is also expanding its digital shopping experience into new territory: offline. The company’s “<a href=# rel=noopener>New Retail</a>” rollout will incorporate in-store promotions and augmented reality experiences in 200,000 “smart” stores across 400 cities.si</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubGRqhHaCjqygp5%2BcmsBusMCyZK%2BrXZe5oq%2FKZp2roZSWxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
