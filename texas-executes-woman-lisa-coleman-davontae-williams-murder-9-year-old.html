Records showed that Williams and her son had been the subject of six child-abuse investigations, the Tribune says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Coleman’s lawyers had contended that the boy’s death was an <a href=# rel=noopener>accident</a>, arguing that the child had mental-health issues and that the two women had exercised poor judgment in trying to handle him, according to the Associated Press.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Murdering a child under 10 years old has been listed as a capital murder offense in Texas since 2011.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Williams, the child’s mother, accepted a plea bargain after Coleman was sentenced to death. She is serving a life sentence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">AP reports that Coleman “mouthed an audible kiss,” as well as “smiled and nodded to several friends and an aunt” in attendance behind glass. She also expressed love for her fellow female prisoners on Texas’ death row and said the women should “keep their heads up.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m all right,” AP reported her as saying. “Tell them I finished strong … God is good.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Coleman’s last words were, “Love you all,” AP says, before she closed her eyes, took “a couple of short breaths” and stopped moving. She was pronounced dead at 6:24 p.m. C.T., 12 minutes after officials administered the execution drug, pentobarbital.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The next execution in Texas, home to the U.S.’s busiest death chamber, is scheduled for Oct. 15. The inmate, <a href=# rel=noopener>Larry Hatten</a>, was convicted in 1995 of shooting a 5-year-old child to death and attempting to kill the child’s mother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsa2lqfnWDjq2csZmjYrK5scKuq56rXay8rq3NZqOiq5FisLC4xKaYp2WUlsOwutOanGavmaG5qq3MrGSmraKZsrN5mGawnpmiYrytsI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
