Those aged 25 to 44 are most prone to fretting about losing their job, at 63%, while furloughed workers aged 55 and over are the least nervous at 50%.</p><p>Furloughed employees aged 18 to 24 are the most likely age group to feel anxious about how the pandemic will impact their career progression (60%) and professional development (55%).</p><p>The older workers get, the less worried they are about the impact of the pandemic on these aspects of their working life, with only a quarter of the oldest workers (those aged 55+) concerned about their career progression, and just one in five worried about their professional development.</p><p>While most furloughed workers have contemplated the prospect of getting laid off, only 11% actually believe they’re unlikely to get their job back. This includes one in twenty (5%) who say it’s “very” unlikely.</p><p>If these instincts are right, it could amount to around 517,000 redundancies in the coming months, as <a href=#>4.7 million workers</a> were furloughed as of January. This is in line with <a href=#>predictions</a> from the ONS and the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p><p>Most furloughed workers feel confident that they’ll get to stay in their job, with just over a third (36%) saying it’s very likely, while another 42% feel fairly certain.</p><p>The research also shows that around one in ten furloughed workers (10%) have not had any communication from their employer since being sent home, while 37% say it has been scarce.</p><p>Around half have either had a fair amount of communication (34%) or a lot (18%).</p><h3>Some furloughed workers have started job hunting, others want to retrain</h3><p><a href=#>Rishi Sunak has previously suggested</a> that people ‘in all walks of life’ should look to find new opportunities. Three in ten furloughed workers (30%) have already started looking for other work, rising to almost half (47%) of those aged 18 to 24.</p><p>A fifth (19%) say they would like to apply for new jobs but there are none in their sector. Around two fifths (44%) are not looking for other work – rising to two thirds (64%) of those aged 55 and older.</p><p>The Chancellor has similarly encouraged workers to retrain, saying they should ‘find ways to adapt and adjust to the new reality'. Around three in ten furloughed workers (28%) say they’re likely to retrain in another sector. This prospect is most popular among younger workers aged 18 to 24 (47%). It drops significantly among those aged 45 to 54 (14%) and 55+ (15%).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksqS7zaiksmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhrZWeBennMqKqtZamkwq%2BzjJ%2Bsq6SfqrSpscNmrqiqm5q%2FtHnFnpirZZmivaKv02aamqqVmr9urQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
