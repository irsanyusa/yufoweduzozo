She is largely seen as a moderate Democrat.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris’ long record in public office—from being San Francisco’s district attorney in 2003, to becoming California state attorney general in 2011, to a Senator from California in 2017, and then Vice President—offers more clues on how she may lead as Democratic nominee and President.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what we know about Harris’ policy positions.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Abortion</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris has consistently supported abortion rights throughout her career, and has been seen as the stronger reproductive rights advocate <a href=#>compared to Biden</a>. As a Senator, she <a href=#>co-sponsored legislation</a> that would ban states from imposing restrictions on abortion rights, and voted against a bill that would ban abortions after <a href=#>20 weeks of pregnancy</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Vice President, she <a href=#>condemned</a> the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade—and became the White House’s leading voice on <a href=#>reproductive health rights</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Earlier this year, <a href=#>Harris visited</a> a Planned Parenthood Clinic in Minnesota, believed to be the first time a sitting U.S. Vice President visited an abortion provider.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Artificial intelligence</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Biden-Harris administration has sought to regulate artificial intelligence, most notably passing a sweeping <a href=#>executive order</a> in October promising to curb threats stemming from AI. And Harris has become the face of some of these key announcements, <a href=#>saying</a> in March that U.S. federal agencies must prove that their AI tools are not harmful to the public.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Republican party has pledged to repeal the executive order, despite public opinion reflecting <a href=#>widespread, bipartisan support</a> of limits on AI development.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">China</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris is likely to continue the Biden Administration’s approach to counter China’s growing influence around the world, often echoing U.S. condemnations of Chinese activities in the Indo-Pacific, and advocating for “<a href=#>de-risking</a>” from Beijing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a Senator, Harris backed legislation <a href=#>promoting human rights in Hong Kong</a> and <a href=#>sanctioning individuals</a> responsible for human rights abuses against Uyghurs in China’s Xinjiang region.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2022, when Vice President Harris met with Chinese President Xi Jinping<a href=#> at the sidelines of the APEC Summit</a>, she reiterated Biden’s statement that “we must maintain open lines of communication to responsibly manage the competition between our countries.” Days later, she <a href=#>visited the Philippines</a> in what was seen as a message to China that the U.S. will continue to support the Southeast Asian country in the face of increasing aggression from Beijing in the contested South China Sea.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She has called China’s actions in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and Taiwan Strait “disturbing.” During a visit to a naval base in Japan in 2022, Harris <a href=#>reiterated</a> U.S. commitment to “continue to support Taiwan’s self-defense, consistent with our long-standing policy.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Climate change</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Climate change is one of the hallmarks of Harris’ political career—an area of interest that <a href=#>can be traced back</a> to her time suing oil giants as San Francisco’s district attorney and later attorney general.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a Senator, Harris was one of the early co-sponsors of the Green New Deal, a blueprint for clean energy transition introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey. She also tried—and failed—to pass the <a href=#>Climate Equity Act</a>, which called for an independent Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability to support communities vulnerable to the climate crisis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During her presidential campaign in 2019, Harris <a href=#>proposed</a> a $10 trillion plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which includes a climate pollution fee, and the ending of federal fossil fuels subsidies.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Vice President, she has advocated publicly for climate action while engaging in <a href=#>behind-the-scenes conversations</a> with officials to facilitate climate legislation, as well as attending private events with environmental leaders. Last December, while attending the COP28 climate summit, Harris <a href=#>announced</a> a $3 billion pledge from the U.S. to the Green Climate Fund.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Crime</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Early on in her career, Harris developed a tough-on-crime reputation as district attorney in California, having <a href=#>boasted</a> about raising conviction rates. She also supported a <a href=#>controversial anti-truancy program</a> that prosecuted the parents of kids who were missing school, which disproportionately affected families of color.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris later tried to steer her reputation into one of a <a href=#>“progressive prosecutor.”</a> Before becoming the Vice President, she had <a href=#>called</a> for an investigation into police shootings and opposition to the death penalty—along with a notable acknowledgement of the <a href=#>racial inequalities</a> undergirding the criminal justice system.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“My entire career has been spent making needed reforms and fighting for those who too often are voiceless—from young people arrested for the first time and getting them jobs instead of jail, to grieving black mothers who wanted justice for their child’s murder as the system ignored their pain,” Harris had <a href=#>said</a> during her presidential campaign in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris, who is the first Black Vice President—and who has faced both <a href=#>sexist and racist attacks</a> from her political opponents—has also previously addressed the issue of racial justice in the country. “I don’t think America is a racist country,” she said during a <a href=#>television interview</a>. “But we also do have to speak truth about the history of racism in our country and its existence today.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Gun control</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since 2023, Harris has <a href=#>overseen</a> the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention created by Biden and remained a prominent face of the Administration’s gun control efforts. (The Biden-Harris Administration in 2022 passed the <a href=#>2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act</a>, the country’s first major gun safety law in nearly three decades.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In March, during a visit to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the site of a mass shooting in 2018, Harris <a href=#>announced</a> the launch of the National Extreme Risk Protection Order Resource Center to support the enforcement of state red flag laws—which permits the temporary seizure of at-risk persons’ firearms—and called on more states to pass such red flag laws.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Economy, taxes, and inflation</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris has vigorously championed assistance to low- and middle-income Americans. As a Senator, she introduced the <a href=#>LIFT the Middle Class Act</a>, which proposed tax credits of $3,000 per person for most middle- and working-class Americans. She was also an early proponent for <a href=#>universal healthcare</a> and <a href=#>forgiving student debt</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Vice President, she <a href=#>supported</a> the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and recently announced a <a href=#>series</a> of <a href=#>measures</a> to make housing more affordable (another issue that she has <a href=#>long pushed for</a>).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2020, Harris was one of the few senators who <a href=#>voted against</a> Trump’s U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement, saying that it did not sufficiently protect American workers nor addressed climate change.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris, who <a href=#>kickstarted</a> in April an Economic Opportunity Tour across the country, has touted the Biden Administration’s record on key economic issues, including supporting small businesses, job creation, infrastructural investment, healthcare accessibility, and erasing student loan debt.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Immigration</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Biden in 2021 had deputized Harris to oversee and <a href=#>solve the root causes of migration</a> from Latin American countries. (Republicans mistakenly called her the “<a href=#>border czar</a>” because of this appointment.)&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In <a href=#>2021</a>, speaking alongside then-Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Harris said: “I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border.” The Biden-Harris administration continues to use a Trump-era rule to turn back most migrant adults. That approach has not sat well with <a href=#>Democrats</a> and migrant <a href=#>rights groups</a>, which advocated for the right of migrants to seek asylum in the U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In March, she announced over <a href=#>$1 billion</a> to respond to the causes of migration and create economic opportunities in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, bringing the total amount of commitments to the program to $5.2 billion since May 2021.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris has also <a href=#>backed</a> a bipartisan border security deal aimed at reducing border crossings. The bill had been rejected twice this year, amid Republican opposition and Democratic <a href=#>divisions</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Israel-Hamas war</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Younger voters, progressives, and Arab Americans may be more receptive to Harris’ candidacy given their opposition to Biden’s strong backing of Israel.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Former officials and analysts say that Harris appears more willing to criticize Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the high death toll in Gaza and express empathy for the plight of Palestinians, <a href=#>NBC News reported</a>. Around 1,200 people were killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, while at least 38,000 Palestinians have been killed since then, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, figures the U.S. and U.N. deem credible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Aaron David Miller, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told NBC News that a Harris presidency would not result in a major change in policy. “When it comes to Israel, she has very moderate views,” Miller said. “To the left of what Biden is prepared to do but way to the right of those who argue we need to impose costs and consequences on Israel to make it clear we’re the superpower and they’re not.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">LGBTQ+ rights</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris is a staunch supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, having spoken out against Florida’s “<a href=#>Don’t Say Gay</a>” law. As Vice President, she has hosted <a href=#>Pride Month receptions</a>, and in 2023, she <a href=#>visited the famed Stonewall Inn</a> in New York to pledge support for the local LGBTQ+ community.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Harris has also been <a href=#>criticized</a> by LGBTQ+ rights advocates<strong> </strong>for writing legal briefs that sought to deny gender-affirming surgery to trans inmates during her stint as California Attorney General.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Ukraine war</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris has followed the Biden Administration’s policy on Ukraine. In an interview with <a href=#>NBC News earlier this year</a>, Harris was asked whether Ukraine can survive a year without American support, to which she responded: “Ukraine needs our support, and we must give it.” Last month, the Vice President represented the U.S. at the Summit of Peace in Ukraine, where she <a href=#>met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky</a> in support of Kyiv. Harris subsequently <a href=#>announced</a> a U.S. commitment of $1.5 billion to help Ukraine’s energy system, humanitarian needs, and civilian security.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She is a vocal critic of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine and, <a href=#>most recently</a>, for the <a href=#>death of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny</a> in a penal colony. “Whatever story they tell, let us be clear: Russia is responsible,” Harris <a href=#>said</a> in February.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Voting rights</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harris has led the Biden Administration’s initiative for federal voting rights and increasing ballot access, a task <a href=#>she asked Biden for</a> in 2021. While a voter legislation bill <a href=#>failed to clear the Senate in 2022</a>, Harris has repeatedly convened with civil rights leaders and <a href=#>outlined strategies</a> “to ensure Americans have the information they need to vote, promote voter participation for students, protect election workers, and fight voter suppression laws.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGBmf3GEjqSYppmclnqprdGroKxlpp6yuL%2BMmpmoqqSevK95xJymp6edrnqqucyinquZpJ68r3nIrKmanZxitKLGwGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
