Here, she spoke of a change in her stance on modern-day feminism. The lady who used to be a strong advocate of feminism said she has realised all too late that it is a scam.</p><p class=align-left>According to her, feminism as a concept and practice is not aimed at uplifting others but at tearing women down. The ex-feminist opposed feminist practitioners vehemently and even pointed accusing fingers at some celebrities who promote it.</p><p class=align-left>Even more, Candace spoke of a 55-year-old woman who share her opinion on modern-day feminism. According to her, the lady voiced out about how much she regrets dabbling in its practice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a2306aa961147cfc.png><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> NAIJ.com upgrades to Legit.ng: a letter from our Editor-in-Chief Bayo Olupohunda</p><p class=align-left>Read Candace's words below:</p><p class=align-left><i>“What the left is really good at doing is hijacking a term that once meant something and pretending that it’s still the same thing when, in fact, it’s not. Really, if you want to see something toxic, tell a feminist - who says they support every idea a woman has - tell a feminist that you’re not a feminist and see what happens. See the way that you get treated.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“I can’t think of women that are nastier and meaner than the ones who exist under these hats, right?"</i></p><p class=align-left>It was after this that she told the crowd about an upsetting comment she read online after having a conversation on the dangers of feminism with Allie Beth Stuckey. According to her, the comment was from a 55-year-old woman who said she fell for the modern day feminist lies.</p><p class=align-left><i>"I learnt too late that feminism was a scam. Today I am 55, I am unmarried, I have passed the age I can have children & I have to take medicines to help keep me happy, and that is the scam of feminism. If there’s anything I could go back and do, I would’ve warned myself against the scam of feminism.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“I believe these voices like Lena Dunham, and Miley Cyrus, and Chelsea Handler are convincing women against themselves, telling women, ‘You don’t need a man. You don’t need anyone. You should want to do everything by yourself. And if you do aspire to that - if you aspire toward nature — then something’s wrong with you."</i></p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Get your daily relationship tips and advice on Africa Love Aid group</a></p><p class=align-left>A Nigerian tweep named Ali shared a video from the long speech given by Candace.
