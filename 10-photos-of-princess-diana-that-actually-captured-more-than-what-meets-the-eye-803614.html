This is&nbsp;why, even so&nbsp;many years later, people are still talking about her personality and we&nbsp;still enjoy her power and beauty. Many of&nbsp;us know that her true emotions were mostly behind the scenes and she was often sad even though there was a&nbsp;smile on&nbsp;her face.</p><p>Today, <strong>Bright Side</strong> and <a href=# title="body language" data-link=tag>body language</a> experts analyzed the photos of&nbsp;Diana and we&nbsp;learned so&nbsp;many new things about her.</p><p><h2>Diana loved being a&nbsp;mother</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/521/f8f/10ac9955c1b0f6df1f760bf251.jpg><p>Diana always showed <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> for her children through physical contact: during walks, she held their hands or&nbsp;put her hand on&nbsp;their shoulders. She often fixed their clothes, and when she talked to&nbsp;them, she often <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>bent down</a> to&nbsp;them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the same level. According to&nbsp;body language experts, this is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the ways to&nbsp;show children you are treating them as&nbsp;equals.</p><p><h2>Even though she was safe, she was still worried about her children</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/280/ed3/c8d87e515994fc9305b58435b4.jpg><p>Diana’s position in&nbsp;this photo demonstrates her wish to&nbsp;protect her children: she keeps them close to&nbsp;herself. Her body language <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>shows</a> that she feels like a&nbsp;protector. Even though there’s nothing to&nbsp;worry about, she looks somewhat alert.</p><p><h2>Diana respected the privacy of&nbsp;her sons but she showed them she was always there</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ee2/286/f5acb158d185004760d64a40f5.jpg><p>During official events, Diana didn’t hug her children in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;everyone else: her body language wasn’t for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>public</a> to&nbsp;see. She allowed her sons to&nbsp;step forward and feel independent, she always let them know she was there and she supported them. Photographers often captured the sweet moments when Diana touched her sons.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was clear from the very beginning that Diana was more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend for Charles than a&nbsp;love interest</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a3a/366/b8eb505abdb78d4ada06df0f3a.jpg><p>What do&nbsp;people in&nbsp;love look like? Definitely not like Diana and Charles during their first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> together after they announced their engagement. They looked awkward in&nbsp;public.</p><p>When he&nbsp;touched her, she’d awkwardly lift her shoulders. Charles tapped her on&nbsp;the shoulder. This is&nbsp;more suitable for a&nbsp;friend than for a&nbsp;woman you love.</p><p><h2>Speaking of&nbsp;love, Diana looked insecure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f14/bc6/3c96bd5c868a6270f6000f2201.jpg><p>Charles looked way calmer when they talked about their engagement. But Diana kept biting her lips, looking down, and just seemed really uncomfortable.</p><p>This is&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> when Charles said his famous words that really disappointed Diana. The journalist asked, “I&nbsp;suppose you’re in&nbsp;love.” Diana says, “Of&nbsp;course!” And Charles adds, “Whatever ‘in&nbsp;love’ means.” After these words, Diana looks down and her smile dies down.</p><p><h2>Even during their wedding, they weren’t really together</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f2/4c0/1535e25ad79b1481a2d145f3aa.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Royal family is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very important event and everyone there has to&nbsp;follow all the rules. But how can truly happy people that love each other not smile at&nbsp;each other or&nbsp;hold each other’s hands at&nbsp;least once? <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Look</a> at&nbsp;the photos from the wedding of&nbsp;Kate Middleton and <a href=# title="Prince William" data-link=tag>Prince William</a>: they look far more sincere than Diana and Charles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c4/f2e/6e1a8e5417a320671ef89c6291.jpg><p>Their body language <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>says</a> that the future husband and wife are always looking in&nbsp;different directions. And even when Charles is&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;Diana, she is&nbsp;concentrated on&nbsp;something else. They look tense and Charles is&nbsp;constantly trying to&nbsp;catch her look or&nbsp;attract her attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b15/9c7/2ebdcd5e56837bb94a9bfea25b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this famous photo, you can see Diana standing quite far from Charles trying to&nbsp;kiss him.</p><p><h2>You can see the alienation in&nbsp;their photos</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/38d/171/435852562bb45064bcc0ac4d2b.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;course, Diana and Charles followed the royal protocol that doesn’t approve of&nbsp;making contact in&nbsp;public. But their body positions in&nbsp;the photos together were often closed: Diana looks like she doesn’t want Charles to&nbsp;take her hand, and then both of&nbsp;them holding their hands behind their backs. Even when they went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tour to&nbsp;Canada, Diana and Charles <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>continued</a> to&nbsp;ignore each other at&nbsp;public events.</p><p><h2>Children didn’t make them any closer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7cf/c3a/7e12895a7aa373e05304a80073.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the photos of&nbsp;Diana, Charles, and Prince William, you can <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>see</a> that Charles is&nbsp;always away, not touching his wife and son. He&nbsp;often had his arms on&nbsp;his lap instead of&nbsp;playing with the kids. Diana, on&nbsp;the other hand, was fully invested in&nbsp;playing with her child.</p><p><h2>But she still had warm feelings for Charles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/173/fee/918548518fbedb7bc5b00c5c34.jpg><p>There are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;photos where Diana looks sad and depressed during her honeymoon. But there are some photos <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>showing</a> that she was really in&nbsp;love. This photo was taken during Charles and Diana’s cruise in&nbsp;the Mediterranean sea. The Princess was happy&nbsp;— you can see in&nbsp;her posture and her sincere smile.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about Princess Diana?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xec%2Bhpq2no2K8p3nPq6Cnm5WowG6wyJqlmmWkna61ecCcq66ZnKHGbq%2FAqauuqpWZeq670Z5kraCRo3q4tMCtZKadlanAbsDHnmSesZVihXF%2FlWpraA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
