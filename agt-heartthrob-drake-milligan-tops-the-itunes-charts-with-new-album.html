His debut album Dallas/Fort Worth, is at the top of the iTunes All-Genre Top Albums and iTunes Top Country Albums charts. It’s clear that his appearances on AGT helped propel his career.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-milligan-breaks-into-the-music-industry-with-debut-album-dallas-fort-worth-review>Drake Milligan Breaks Into the Music Industry With Debut Album Dallas/Fort Worth Review</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drake Milligan</a> has officially released his first album and it’s nothing less than great. Dallas/Fort Worth is filled with good songwriting and added swagger from his Elvis Presley influence. I would recommend this album to anyone that loved Milligan on the series.</p><p>The 14 track album contains two songs America’s Got Talent fan favorite songs, “Sounds Like Something I’ll Do” and “Kiss Goodbye All Night.” Following the two already-heard songs, the album gets down and dirty with fast and slow tunes.</p><p>Some of the best on the album are slow tune “She,” breakup anthem “Hearts Don’t Break Even,” and slow tune “Dance of a Lifetime.” Each of these tracks have fantastic songwriting, vocals, and composition. Out of the three, I’d have to say that “Dance of a Lifetime” is my favorite.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The first guest on Milligan’s album is country legend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vince Gill</a> on “Goin’ Down Swingin’.” This track is about being brave, strong and courageous even in the face of adversities. The next album guest is guitarist James Burton, who appears in the early relationship tune “Long Haul.”</p><p>Milligan’s debut album ends off with a beautiful cowboy serenade, “Cowboy Kind Of Way.” This song is all about a lady the singer desires.</p><p>The album’s release is on major label <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBR</a> and has an overall nineties country feel to the songs. The album is everything you want country music in 2022 to be and leaves you hopeful for the present and the future of country music.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Milligan’s AGT Experience Changed his Life</h2><p>Milligan’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">third place</a> finish on AGT was an overall positive experience, stating that it was “a fever dream.” Following his run on AGT, Milligan is hitting the road to deliver the new music on his headlining tour.</p><p>The most notable stop on the tour will be Billy Bob’s in Fort Worth, Texas on September 23. The venue is very close to where Milligan grew up, and it is like a dream come true for Milligan to perform there. Milligan is set for a great career and without a doubt, his AGT experience truly changed his life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>We can’t wait to see what’s up next for Milligan. It’s clear that his future following America’s Got Talent is very bright.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_SelmaBlair_PashaPashkov_ABC.jpg alt="Selma Blair Shares What It Meant to Let Go of Her Cane on ‘Dancing with the Stars’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>agt</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Drake Milligan</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZqCVlr%2B1wMerpptllKeurLGMpqClpJmcrq9506inrGWknbJutdOupZ6rXZi1or7TrGSwoaSdeq%2Bx1maYpZqlonw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
