The very first episode features Ariana Grande. Known for her incredible vocal range, Grande perfectly demonstrates how she always keeps her singing voice sharp.</strong></p><p>Eric coaches everyone from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Legend</a> to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Camila Cabello</a>. Though everyone he works with is a bonafide star, Eric refers to all of his clients as “students.” He believes that having singers practice a capella really trains their ears. Eric first met Grande in 2007, and they have since established a great friendship and working relationship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ariana-grande-gives-fans-an-inside-look-at-vocal-lessons>Ariana Grande Gives Fans an Inside Look at Vocal Lessons</h2><p>At one of Eric and Grande’s first lessons together, they worked on “I Have Nothing” by Whitney Houston. She later performed the song with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Foster</a> on the piano. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice coach</a> said she was “so in awe” of the entire experience. Over the years, Eric has invited Grande to parties at his house where she got to let loose and sing show tunes with her friends.</p><p>“Listening to musical theater is a different kind of fulfilling car ride,” Grande said. “You know if you throw on some Avenue Q or Wicked in the car you’re just guaranteed to feel comforted.”</p><p>Grande noted that there is a “humongous difference” between singing pop and Broadway. She said that she uses a totally different part of her voice for each genre and would never sing a Broadway song with her pop placement. She grew up singing theater so that’s where her heart lies. Grande hilariously demonstrated how her song “Side to Side” would sound in her Broadway voice. She forgot the words even though she helped write the song.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CVQaelJJWUc/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-grande-gets-real-about-getting-sick-on-tour>Grande Gets Real About Getting Sick on Tour</h2><p>Grande got candid about being a perfectionist during her vocal lessons on Backstage Pass with Eric Vetro. On performance days, Vetro usually does vocal warmups with his students over FaceTime. He emphasized that doing constant shows all the time is not easy and often leads to artists getting sick. Artists very rarely want to cancel shows and feel like they are disappointing fans. Grande had to cancel a few shows in the past when she was sick with bronchitis.</p><p>“I’ve unfortunately had to cancel a couple of shows in the past, of course, like six years because I think that it is physically so demanding and so strenuous to do hundreds of shows around the world and it’s incredible but it’s also physically very tasking between the traveling, and the flying, and the bus, and everything,” she said. “And it’s like your body becomes very run-down and I know for me personally I was sick for like four out of 10 months on the Sweetener Tour and thankfully I only had to cancel one show I think or two.”</p><p>Grande credited Eric’s vocal warmups for helping her get through days when she was sick or lost her voice. She would do the vocal exercises throughout the day so she could get her voice back by the time of her performance. So much preparation goes into each performance. Backstage Pass with Eric Vetro is such a cool podcast concept and it was fun to hear clips of some of Grande’s vocal warmups.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Voice-Carter-Rubin.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Winner Carter Rubin Releases New Song, Coach Gwen Stefani is “So Proud”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ariana grande</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571aiamqRdmLyir8dmq6hlpJ2ybr%2FTmqmsZZWntqR51Z6rq6ddqLa1v4ydprCmXay2tbSMmqmimZ6Weqi%2BwKebnmWWpL9uusSwZKmnlJiutMCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
