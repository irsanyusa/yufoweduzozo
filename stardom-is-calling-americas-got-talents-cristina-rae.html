During the first round of auditions, Cristina <a href=#>introduced her son</a> Jeremiah before she belted out “In the Air Tonight” by Phil Collins. Her story of being a single mom who had often experienced homelessness on her quest to superstardom brought tears to the eyes of those who watched. Did the hardworking mom achieve the stardom she worked so hard for?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>After being told to sing another song by judge <a href=# class=broken_link>Simon Cowell</a>, Cristina chose “Gimme Shelter” by The Rolling Stones.The judges and audience watched as she brought the house down. Cristina’s first round performance earned her the <a href=#>Golden Buzzer from judge Heidi Klum</a>, which sent her straight to the quarterfinals.&nbsp;</p><p>Week after week, the Nashville, Tenn. native received a thunderous applause for her renditions of songs like Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” and “Demons” by Imagine Dragons. She earned standing ovations for each performance, securing her spot at the finale where she came in third place.&nbsp;</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-after-america-s-got-talent-cristina-continues-to-work-on-her-music-career>After America’s Got Talent, Cristina Continues to Work on Her Music Career</h2><p>Cristina split her time between Atlanta and New York City after her appearance on America’s Got Talent. The songstress bounced around from audition to audition, took dance classes, and even tried Burlesque. Hoping for a win, Cristina took advantage of the Covid-19 quarantine and used her talents, so that more ears could hear her phenomenal voice.&nbsp;</p><p>With advice from her mentor, Cristina auditioned for the musical Dreamgirls this past Spring. The musical was presented by Clubhouse and was expected to draw in close to 4,000 listeners. Cristina landed the role of Effie White after the long audition process, which included singing for Glee star Amber Riley.</p><p>“To know that we were being heard, to be able to perform again, even though it was in an unconventional way, it was a performance again. I think that’s what a lot of us need and want right now, so I’m just happy that I’ve been given the opportunity to perform again, even if it’s just through an audio app,” Cristina said in an <a href=#>interview </a>about her experience.</p><p>Now, Cristina continues to perform throughout different clubs with other upcoming singers. She previously gave a jaw dropping performance of “<a href=#>Feeling Good”</a> by Nina Simone at the Center For Nonprofit Management of Nashville.&nbsp;</p><p>Cristina is also spreading body positivity across her social media through modeling and she recently launched her own sneaker collection. Next for the singer is a new single and video that will be coming soon.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-08-at-1.54.58-PM.png alt="Benson Boone is Thriving Since ‘American Idol’ Withdrawal" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>cristina rae</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570q2Yq5yfonqqv4ycmKWkmaO0bq3Mnqmim5Goeqi702armqSVo8G0ecKroKysmaOubr7AnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
