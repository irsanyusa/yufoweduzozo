Before you make your move, weigh the pros and cons of living in Austria’s capital with our side-by-side comparison.</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=25.964500273075><tr><td>PROS</td><td>CONS</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Transportation: Vienna is a very bicycle-friendly city, has excellent public transportation and is well-connected to other European cities by rail and plane.</td><td>Prices are relatively standard for a world-class capital, but comparatively expensive among European cities. Austria is not a cashless society, so expect to pay cash in many places.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Austrian and Viennese culture is lively and you’ll find world-class museums, opera, classical and modern music, astonishing architecture and tasty cuisine in the city.</td><td>Depending on your preferences, things to do in Vienna are less diverse than in other capitals of similar size. Things close on Sundays or the weekend!</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>English is widely spoken, though not all Austrians speak it. Yet because English is a popular business language, it’s always on the rise.</td><td>The weather definitely gets cold and dark in the winter for quite some time. Stay away if you can’t deal with four full seasons.</td></tr><tr readability=5.5409836065574><td>Austria has a good healthcare system and you’ll get access as an expat.</td><td>Similar to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German culture</a>, making local friends is a slow and steady process instead of instant acquaintances.</td></tr><tr readability=5.3947368421053><td>Austria has a high democracy index and the city is family and LGBTQ+ friendly.</td><td>If you consider German hard to learn, the Austrian variant of the language adds an extra challenge. (Find out more about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">differences in dialects</a>.)</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Vienna is very safe and has good infrastructure with safe roads, fast internet, and high-quality education.</td><td>Locals in Vienna have a certain attitude which foreigners often perceive as rude, though it just comes down to cultural differences. It’s definitely not the service mentality you might be used to from the US!</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>It’s fairly easy for foreigners to do business in Vienna (though income tax is high).</td><td>Housing can be expensive and challenging to find. Expect to pay (high) agent fees!</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Living-in-Vienna-as-an-expat-or-digital-nomad>Living in Vienna as an expat or digital nomad</h2><p>Vienna ranks among the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">top hundred destinations</a> for digital nomads and expats, making it a popular and rewarding city for foreigners.

Austria’s capital has a reputation for being family-friendly, safe and relaxing and friendly to foreigners.</p><p>Internet speed is fast with an average of 42 Mbps, air quality is good and there are sufficient places such as coworking spaces from which you can work. However, the difficulty of starting your own business in the city (or in Austria) is moderately high and the housing or office space expenses for a central location can be prohibitive for some.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cost of living</h3><p>The cost of living in Vienna varies, depending on your status and the services available to you. When you’re only passing through as a digital nomad, you’ll spend more on average with monthly expenses of roughly €2,400.
