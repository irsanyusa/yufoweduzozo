Both deal with heavy issues like racism and sexism. How has working on them changed the way you think?</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=372><strong data-reactid=373>Danielle Brooks:</strong> Art imitates life, life imitates art. You can't escape it—especially in the time that we live in. Having a voice is so important. If you have a platform, I believe you should use it. I am still figuring out how to make a difference beyond tweeting about something. I'm 26 years old, and I think it's the perfect age to figure it out. I've been thinking a lot that I'd like to get involved in reminding people to vote—it's so important for women and young people. So that's something I really want to focus on.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=376><strong data-reactid=377>SW:</strong> Were you surprised by the emotional reaction fans had to last season of OITNB?</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=379><strong data-reactid=380>DB:</strong> [Warning: Spoiler ahead.] I knew it was coming. I'm so grateful for every fan we have. Here's what was interesting: I got many tweets about how devastated people were about Poussey dying. When Alton Sterling was shot and killed by police, I posted something and I didn't get the same reaction. It broke my heart. I want people to have the same connection with real people as they did to Poussey. The work I'm doing—there's a purpose for it.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=382><strong data-reactid=383>SW:</strong> One way you've made a difference already is by being an advocate for curvy women. Have you always been confident with your shape?</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=385><strong data-reactid=386>DB:</strong> My mother always told me, "No one is always anything." That's so true about my body. I have been comfortable in my skin more days than less, but I still have moments.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=388><strong data-reactid=389>SW:</strong> Okay, so what do you do when you're having one of those moments?</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 end text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=391><strong data-reactid=392>DB:</strong> To be honest, it's a daily thing. Something I learned at Juilliard is that being positive is a choice. Sometimes it feels good to live in a negative place, but it feels great to live in positivity. So, I say, "F— the world and their standards. Today I choose to love my life." I'm still working at being the best and happiest Dani that I can be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmacp5yhsqTAyKilaJmdmr%2Bqr8CnZK%2BnmZiytHmRaWhwZ2RqgXqBlW1mnZmenrKtuMRmmaunn6DAbq3Mnqmim5Gjere7yJycrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
