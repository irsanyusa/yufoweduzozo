On April 6 you state that “pigs eat coal with relish, digest it with ease.” This idea was rooted in a statement in my Next Hundred Years— ”Hogs eat coal and enjoy it” (TIME, June 1). Hogs undoubtedly eat coal. Many a mid-western porker sees the black lumps of bituminous coal constantly before him supplied by his indulgent master. If munching effectively and with gusto is a mark of enjoyment, then the pigs actually enjoy this unusual foodstuff, apparently considerably more than the average American enjoys his daily slabs of charred bread at breakfast. I wish to point out, however, that enjoyment and digestion are not synonymous. In the case of the hog the coal passes through well pulverized, but it is doubtful if he digests it, for probably no noteworthy chemical changes take place in the process. He is given coal to “tone him up” and aid his alimentary wellbeing. The exact function of this carbonaceous material is not known. It probably has the same effect as charcoal which is put into prepared dog foods— whatever that may be.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">C. C.

On the return of myself and wife from a winter’s cruise in Illinois, I proceeded to empty the ashes in my furnace which Fred had attended to during our absence. I was puzzled to see no fresh ashes on the dump or any evidence of ashes except that the coal (anthracite) bin was nearly empty. “Can’t I have those ashes?” asked Fred. “Sure, but what do you want them for?” I countered. “I want to feed them to my hogs,” quoth Fred. “Go way back and sit down,” I remarked testily. “Come and see,” said Fred. He took a basketful of ashes and cinders and gave them to the porkers who ate them ravenously. That galoot Fred had been wintering his hogs with my ashes, and they appeared to thrive on them.

As a University of Minnesota man I would like to report on the regrettable lack of family traditions out here in the Middle West. Traditions are much undervalued: even opposed. Not long ago I heard another University of Minnesota man remark, “Can you imagine it—my whole family religiously eats Wheaties every morning!” I considered the remark interesting in that itillustrates the blind resistance of Minnesota men to the growth of tradition. In this case I strongly suspected that a few traditions would do the young man’s family no harm whatever. (He is a mere acquaintance: I hardly know the fellow, really.) My own family, I am happy to report, resembles the socially prominent families of the East in its loyalty to family traditions. As an instance, we wear nothing but Munsingwear garments next to the skin. Nothing else will do, you understand. Moreover, of late a new tradition has taken hold: we are becoming quite athletically inclined, and as a result have now used six bottles of Absorbine Jr. I have wondered, now and then, whether this is sufficient to constitute a full-fledged family tradition. By Minnesota standards? Perhaps. But by Yale standards? It is doubtful. Eight or nine bottles would be another matter, but I’minclined to think six bottles would not be quite enough. A.

I am more than 60 years of age and have five children and nine grandchildren. In your May 25 issue, I read that S. A. Chase comments unfavorably concerning your art section in the May 11 issue where there was displayed the figure of a slightly less than nude woman—Sunday Morning. To me this print was alluring and certainly proper from all viewpoints. Our young people in our private and public schools are taken to the art museums where there is more or less nudity displayed. Our public buildings many times have statuary of more or less nudity. I invite the attention of Mr. S. A. Chase to the May 1936 bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art. This is the first time I have known of a Chase who did not admire the nudity of a woman in the flesh or otherwise. W. W. CHASE President The Cleveland Real Estate Investment Co.

Must children and adults wear blinders when they visit the traveling Van Gogh Exhibit? Must we as parents and teachers strive to keep children innocent and at the same time expect them to find their way in the world when they leave the protection of the home? My six-year-old son looks at TIME pictures (news and advertising) regularly and of course sees the nude pictures along with the others. Sunday Morning (TIME, May 11) aroused mild curiosity on his part which gave me the opportunity to answer some very pertinent questions. I welcome this opportunity and sincerely hope that TIME, the all-family magazine, will continue to print newsworthy pictures. MRS. WILLIAM E.

About 2,000 of these were delivered in their homes by internes or externes of the hospital. The others were delivered in the hospital because they preferred it or because the staff thought it advisable.

TIME is to be complimented upon its brisk descriptive damning of Balanchine’sOrpheus and Eurydicc [TIME, June 1. Critics of the daily papers indulged in obscure epithets and bigotted defence of what they term tradition, in the ferocious die-hard manner. TIME’S policy, I believe, is to report the response of the public to such a performance in the spirit in which it reports the performance, as news: not to give individual opinion of its writers. In this case it failed to note the existence of two camps, two mutually exclusive views of the future of opera in New York. I submit what follows as information rather than resentful protest.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The present Orpheus, the only original undertaking of the opera association this season, gave as much pleasure to a certain public as offense to the critics. . . . Attentive to the American Ballet’s young reputation, and admiring Balanchine and Tchelitchev, we crowded the Metropolitan. By virtue of the strange new scenes and 20th-century dances. I was more deeply moved by the old myth and music than ever before. I know that some 30 or 40 persons of my acquaintance also were not disappointed. . . . Balanchine is a very great man, I think. If I were to make a list of the dozen most exciting and inspiring things I have seen in the theatre, three of his choreographic works would be on it: Apollon Musagcte (Stravinsky) and The Prodigal Son (Prokoviev) and Errante, revived at the Metropolitan this season. But I am not at all disposed by general admiration to admire all that he does: quite the contrary. The Bat, for example, bores me. Need I add that I am not in anyone’s pay? I did not receive complimentary tickets for Orpheus, nor do I know anyone who did. Now may I repeat that it gave me greater satisfaction and interested me more than any other art-event of the past season? I saw it both times it was given. I hope it will be given again. And I should like to see developed at the Metropolitan a new type of operatic art, uninhibited, unconventional, as suggested by it. I know that many people are of my opinion. Nothing has been done, and there has not even been time for the curiosity of a great many more, who never set foot in the opera house at present, to be aroused. And I understand that it needs new patronage.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">… In respect to art, when there is real difference of taste and a new division of opinion, it is not easy to be impartial. TIME’S reporter, for instance, says that the dance of the three principals together at the end of the opera suggests “a Japanese tumbling act.” No doubt this comparison was scornfully intended. Yet it might be read as a. compliment. For to those of us who find classic operatic pantomime ludicrous and of waning significance, the acts of acrobats often seem very fine. No doubt inadvertently, TIME has taken sides with the powerful old guard as against a merely potent young generation.
