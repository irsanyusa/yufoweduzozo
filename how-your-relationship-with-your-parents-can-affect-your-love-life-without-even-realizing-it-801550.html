We&nbsp;might not be&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;it, but the way we&nbsp;interact with them could also have a&nbsp;strong impact on&nbsp;our own relationships. As&nbsp;clinical psychologist Dr. Rebecca Bergen <a href=#>explains</a>, we&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;“internalize” the examples we&nbsp;see from our folks and apply them to&nbsp;our own lives.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>,<strong> </strong>we&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;healthy relationships, and we’d like to&nbsp;help shed some light on&nbsp;how our parents could influence the way we&nbsp;give and receive love. We’ll also share some tips on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;break free of&nbsp;negative relationship patterns.</p><p>Here are 4&nbsp;ways parents could unknowingly affect our romantic perceptions and behaviors.</p><p><h2>1. Having neglectful parents could make you more insecure or&nbsp;needy when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;relationships.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3da/827/db40db56908ab4fbf2048cfceb.jpg><p>Inattentive and negligent parents could trigger <a href=#>attention-seeking</a> behavior in&nbsp;their children. This type of&nbsp;conduct can extend through adulthood, and eventually, into these people’s relationships. <strong>Ignored children can grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very needy</strong>, often demanding attention from their partners because their parents deprived them of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Neglect may also cause <a href=#>abandonment issues</a>, and people who are afraid of&nbsp;being deserted tend to&nbsp;feel more insecure about their loved ones and friends. They have a&nbsp;difficult time trusting their partner, and they are also more likely to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;unhealthy relationships.</p><p><h2>2. If&nbsp;your parents don’t usually show emotions or&nbsp;affection, it&nbsp;could affect the way you express your love to&nbsp;your partner.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f21/e0b/12128b531f8cf2997fd3c44010.jpg><p>Dr. Bergen states that <strong>a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;physical affection from parents, such as&nbsp;hugs or&nbsp;kisses, may cause an&nbsp;<a href=#>aversion</a> to&nbsp;these actions</strong>. Dr. Scott Carroll <a href=#>adds</a> that children who grew up&nbsp;with parents that discouraged showing emotions may end up&nbsp;being “stoic and unexpressive in&nbsp;their relationships.”</p><p>These people usually have difficulties <a href=# title=communicating data-link=tag>communicating</a> with their partners, and they struggle with the physical or&nbsp;intimate aspects of&nbsp;the relationship. They resort to&nbsp;other ways of&nbsp;expressing their love instead&nbsp;— like by&nbsp;offering gifts and allocating time for their significant other.</p><p><h2>3. Growing up&nbsp;with divorced or&nbsp;unmarried parents could make you very cautious and doubtful about your relationships.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/63b/b6a/19a0265f349bedcce467d7a383.jpg><p><a href=#>Research</a> indicates that children with <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a> parents are more likely to&nbsp;lose faith in&nbsp;marriage, and they’re less likely to&nbsp;consider matrimonial unions as&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-term commitment. Dr. Carroll, however, <a href=#>explains</a> that 2&nbsp;things can happen to&nbsp;adults after their parents separate&nbsp;— either these people become extremely cautious with their partners, or&nbsp;they carelessly dive right in&nbsp;but also end the relationship just as&nbsp;fast.</p><p>Relationship expert April Masini <a href=#>shares</a> another view, saying that witnessing divorce and its consequences could motivate some people to&nbsp;avoid committing the same mistakes and push them to&nbsp;work harder on&nbsp;their relationships.</p><p><h2>4. Having attentive and expressive parents could make you more open and affectionate in&nbsp;relationships.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64b/4db/a6a4bb5b9db2ebda71f4c342c4.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;the results of&nbsp;one <a href=#>study</a>, supportive parents raise children with fewer behavioral problems. Dr. Carroll also <a href=#>mentions</a> that helpful parents can guide their children on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;deal with relationship troubles.</p><p>Child psychologist and parenting expert, Dr. Vanessa Lapointe, <a href=#>notes</a> that <strong>the love we&nbsp;receive from our folks serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;framework for how we&nbsp;think love should&nbsp;be</strong>. If&nbsp;parents are emotionally expressive and present, their sons and daughters are more likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;comfortable with sharing their feelings, opinions, and affection toward their partners.</p><p>In&nbsp;case you begin to&nbsp;notice some of&nbsp;these negative patterns within your relationship, here are a&nbsp;few tips that could help you deal with these challenges.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep in&nbsp;mind that past relationships don’t have to&nbsp;determine present ones.</strong></li></ul><p>Just because your parents didn’t have a&nbsp;successful marriage doesn’t mean that you are destined to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;failed relationship as&nbsp;well. While past experiences or&nbsp;traumas could affect your perspective in&nbsp;life, as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult, <strong>you are capable of&nbsp;making your <a href=#>own decisions</a> and shaping your own future.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Learn from past lessons.</strong></li></ul><p>Take all the negative memories and use them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder of&nbsp;what you should avoid doing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship. If&nbsp;you were deprived of&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy or&nbsp;healthy family connection when you were younger, <strong>take this opportunity to&nbsp;strive for a&nbsp;better bond with your partner.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Be&nbsp;more self-aware.</strong></li></ul><p>Dr. Bergen <a href=#>suggests</a> reflecting on&nbsp;your childhood to&nbsp;recall your interaction with your parents and hopefully identify if&nbsp;certain patterns are manifesting in&nbsp;your relationships. Writing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;journal can also help you dive deeper into your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. If&nbsp;you’re having a&nbsp;difficult time dealing with all the negativity, consider seeing a&nbsp;therapist.</p><ul><li><strong>Communicate with your partner.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Open communication promotes healthy relationships</strong> and creates a&nbsp;stronger bond between you and your significant other. Dr. Bergen also recommends exploring new things with your partner, connecting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;deeper level, and freely expressing your emotions to&nbsp;each other.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think your experience with your parents affected your past or&nbsp;current relationship?
