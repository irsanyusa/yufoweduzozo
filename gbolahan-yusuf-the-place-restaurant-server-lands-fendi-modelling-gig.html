I have visited the place countless times to get food and have seen Gbolahan quite often, as he has attended to me a number of times. Until the day it clicked! I looked at him as he printed my bill over the desk, and I said to myself, 'How come I haven't seen this? How did it take me so long to realise this?' Well, without hesitating, I took out my phone and made the first video on the slide. I sent it straight to my boss, Cias Model.</p><p>"He said it was interesting that we could see more without his cap, and that was how we started.</p><p>"Today, Gbolahan, from behind the desk as a restaurant server boy in Lagos, Nigeria, made his first debut in Milan for Fendi!"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Gbolahan's story has gone viral, with many Nigerians expressing happiness about his journey from humble beginnings.</p><p>The model also shared his gratitude on Instagram, especially to his agents, including Temi, in a post on Monday, June 17, 2024, accompanied by a picture of him on the runway.</p><p>"I really just want to say a big thank you to everyone for the outpouring of love and support. You all don’t know me but have shown me so much love.
