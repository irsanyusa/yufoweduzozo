In 2018, while promoting Deadpool 2, Reynolds appeared on the show as Unicorn. He sang “Tomorrow” from the musical Annie.</p><p>During a recent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">appearance on Today</a> to promote his new film Spirited, Reynolds recalled his experience on the competition, saying he wanted to appear on “the weirdest show we can do.” He added that “no Westerner had ever been on the show” before him.</p><p>“I was in actual hell,” Reynolds said of his time on the show. “When I was there, I was like, ‘Why did I sign up to do this? This is horrible. This is truly horrible.'”</p><p>Reynolds explained that he didn’t know the song, calling his experience “traumatic.” You’d never know it from the video of his unmasking, in which he smiled and waved at the fans. He then joked, “I’m so sorry about that song.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">THE BEST ‘MASKED SINGER’ PERFORMANCES IN HONOR OF THE 100TH EPISODE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-show-premiered-in-the-u-s-in-2019>The Show Premiered in the U.S. in 2019</h2><p>The year after Reynolds performed on The Masked Singer in South Korea, the American version premiered on FOX, and it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has since become a hit show</a>.

That includes Season 1 contestant Margaret Cho (aka Poodle).</p><p>“I was claustrophobic the entire time,” Cho told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>. “The worst part was that somebody, I don’t even know who it was, somebody was talking to me a lot in the mask, through the snout, and he had really bad breath which got stuck in the snout. So I would end up breathing recycled bad breath from somebody else for a long period of time. That was not something I signed up for.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_LaurenAlaina_Johnny-LouisFilmMagic.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Star Lauren Alaina is Ready to Marry Her Secret Beau" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570bKYp2Wimsavu8udqmaqlZiurbjSZqurmaWirrW1wmacsaiVp7amusKeZKimXam1pnnMmqqknZRiwKq6xp6pZqGeYsCwwdOhZKSnopqucA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
