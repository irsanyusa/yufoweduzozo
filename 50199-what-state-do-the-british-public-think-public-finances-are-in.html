A clear majority of Britons (61%) agree with the chancellor that the last government has left public finances in a bad state, including 35% who see the finances as being ‘very bad’.</p><p data-block-key=1lgfo>Although the prospect had been raised that Reeves would use her speech to announce increases in tax, including by the opposition Conservatives, who have stated that <a href=#>Reeves’ approach is a ‘con’</a> that is laying the groundwork for tax rises in this autumn’s budget, the chancellor ruled out increasing taxes for working people.</p><p data-block-key=9v62b>This will reassure much of the public, with fewer than one in six (15%) Britons feeling that the government should increase taxes right now. Nor is there much appetite for tax cuts, the preferred path of just 29% of the public, including only 37% of Conservative voters. The most common position of the public, at four in ten Britons (41%), is that the correct path for the moment is keeping taxes at the current level.</p><p data-block-key=58b6o>But even if Reeves did raise taxes, would she get the blame? A third of Britons (32%) say that any tax rises in this autumn’s budget will mainly be down to choices by Labour, while a similar three in ten (30%) view the state of public finances left by the last Conservative government as primarily responsible for any increases in tax. More than a quarter (27%) of the public say they would consider both governments equally responsible for the chancellor upping the tax bill.</p><p data-block-key=c0an9>Rather expectedly, Conservative voters are far more likely to view tax rises as an active choice of the Labour government (73%), while only 3% see them as a consequence of the last government’s actions. By contrast, only one in eight (12%) Labour voters would see them solely as a choice by Starmer’s new government, with six in ten (58%) believing them to be required by the current state of public finances. More than one in five (21-23%) of both parties’ voters see both governments as responsible to some extent.</p><p data-block-key=3mk5k><b>See the full results</b> <a href=#><b>here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=461ac>How do you feel about taxation, the economy in general, and everything else?
