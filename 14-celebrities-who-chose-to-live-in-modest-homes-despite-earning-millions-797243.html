The amount of&nbsp;money that some people spent on&nbsp;their lavish houses often looks extravagant to&nbsp;us. However, though it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;believe, some celebrities agree with you and live in&nbsp;modest homes despite being worth millions of&nbsp;dollars. This argument can be&nbsp;proven by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Matthew McConaughey" data-link=tag>Matthew McConaughey</a> and his motorhome, John Krasinski and his bachelor apartment, and Kesha and her bungalow. These are just a&nbsp;few examples of&nbsp;celebrities who choose to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;inexpensive homes, voluntarily.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>compiled a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;celebrities who, at&nbsp;certain times in&nbsp;their lives, preferred to&nbsp;spend money on&nbsp;things more important than just some additional square feet.</p><p><h2>1. Robert Pattinson</h2></p><p>Around 6&nbsp;months after ending his relationship with <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a>, with whom he&nbsp;shared a&nbsp;large <a href=#>house</a> in&nbsp;<a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a> (which measured at&nbsp;4,026 square feet in&nbsp;size, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;exact), decided to&nbsp;sell his property and move to&nbsp;a&nbsp;nearby home within the same city, but it&nbsp;was way more modest. <a href=#>Pattinson</a>, with an&nbsp;estimated wealth of&nbsp;<a href=#>$100&nbsp;million</a>, bought a&nbsp;nearly 2,000-square-foot home for a&nbsp;mere <a href=#>$2,176,500</a>.</p><p>The home boasts a&nbsp;“rustic” look decorated with high-end finishes and only 2&nbsp;bedrooms and 2&nbsp;bathrooms. Another modest feature of&nbsp;the home serves as&nbsp;the actor’s refuge, located behind another house, accessible only through a&nbsp;long, enclosed corridor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ed/cbb/982f035672b2735f1256f67da3.jpg><p><h2>2. Vincent Kartheiser</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d0/5d8/cc04255c2f8d1462211bbd6f88.jpg><p><a href=#>Kartheiser</a>, who played advertising executive Peter Campbell on&nbsp;<a href=#>Mad Men</a>, lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;500-square-foot <a href=#>booth</a> of&nbsp;sorts. Yes, you read that correctly, 500 square feet. It&nbsp;turns out that the actor bought this place at&nbsp;the wrong time and in&nbsp;an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;get his money back, the home underwent a&nbsp;total remodel while he&nbsp;was living there. Inspired by&nbsp;the concept of&nbsp;industrial houses in&nbsp;Japan, Kartheiser sought to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;apartment with every comfort, while taking advantage of&nbsp;every available inch.</p><p>He&nbsp;was finally able to&nbsp;sell the cabin, but for much less than he&nbsp;had expected since the original price was <a href=#>$808,000</a> and he&nbsp;sold it&nbsp;for <a href=#>$650,000</a>. He&nbsp;actually bought the site for <a href=#>$547,000</a>. But considering the total remodeling job, which likely cost him more than $100,000, you could say it&nbsp;wasn’t exactly a&nbsp;highly profitable investment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e9/3a6/1c15e75213abfaf02bee372c9c.jpg><p><h2>3. Jennifer Lawrence</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc0/d56/bf873e51d9a69b650cbd280c44.jpg><p>This renowned actress, who in&nbsp;2015 was declared by&nbsp;Forbes as&nbsp;the best-paid actor in&nbsp;the world (raising $52 million that year alone), also had her moment of&nbsp;“humility.” Even during that high-grossing year, <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> continued to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;1,413-square-foot <a href=#>condo</a> located in&nbsp;Santa Monica. In&nbsp;2012 she had said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that she was used to&nbsp;living in&nbsp;“normal” places, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;strange for her to&nbsp;find herself alone in&nbsp;a&nbsp;large mansion. However, despite those statements, she has made 2&nbsp;significant investments: in&nbsp;2014, she bought a&nbsp;5,500-square-foot Los Angeles house and in&nbsp;2017, a&nbsp;$9-million-dollar, over 3,100-square-foot <a href=#>Tribeca condo</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a04/270/192957594d8277e46fad29e686.jpg><p><h2>4. Matthew McConaughey</h2></p><p>It’s well known in&nbsp;show business that <a href=#>McConaughey</a> has certain bohemian tendencies. And it’s no&nbsp;wonder: for a&nbsp;few years, he&nbsp;<a href=#>lived</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;house trailer of&nbsp;just under 28&nbsp;square feet. Even before eventually leaving it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;trailer park and renting a&nbsp;house with his girlfriend upon the birth of&nbsp;their first child, the actor used his trailer as&nbsp;a&nbsp;home and office. What “luxuries” did this little trailer contain? A&nbsp;satellite dish on&nbsp;the roof, a&nbsp;barbecue at&nbsp;the back, and some racks and nets where he&nbsp;kept his books and scripts. What else do&nbsp;you need to&nbsp;live a&nbsp;happy life?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/121/8c6/fb6373524bbe499d552cf9849b.jpg><p><h2>5. Lena Dunham</h2></p><p>As&nbsp;hard as&nbsp;it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;to&nbsp;believe, the protagonist and creator of&nbsp;the hit series, Girls lived in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>apartment</a> with just one bedroom and one bathroom. <a href=#>Dunham</a> bought this 800-square-foot property in&nbsp;2012, the year of&nbsp;her series’ premiere, for only $500,000. However, when we&nbsp;see where the home is&nbsp;located, that price seems small compared to&nbsp;the price tags that are found in&nbsp;the vicinity. The apartment was located in&nbsp;Brooklyn Heights, the affluent residential area of&nbsp;New York City.</p><p>But she didn’t stay in&nbsp;that apartment for long. In&nbsp;2014, she rented it&nbsp;out and in&nbsp;2017, finally sold it&nbsp;for $850,000, earning more than $300,000 in&nbsp;profit.</p><p><h2>6. Elijah Wood</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/97b/6b2/e5a7895baf9922d30c9e59f93a.jpg><p><a href=#>Elijah Wood</a> definitely doesn’t need great luxuries to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy. In&nbsp;2013, the actor bought his Austin <a href=#>home</a> for just over $1&nbsp;million. The property belonging to&nbsp;the actor best known for his role as&nbsp;Frodo in&nbsp;<a href=#>The Lord of&nbsp;the Rings</a> is&nbsp;designed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Victorian style, and even though its price is&nbsp;barely over a&nbsp;million, it’s about 3,200 square feet in&nbsp;size.</p><p><h2>7. Deion Sanders</h2></p><p><a href=#>Sanders</a>, who has a&nbsp;place in&nbsp;the NFL Hall of&nbsp;Fame, also has a&nbsp;net worth of&nbsp;about <a href=#>$40&nbsp;million</a>. However, he&nbsp;chose to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;house of&nbsp;around 29,122-square-foot in&nbsp;Prosper, <a href=# title=Texas data-link=tag>Texas</a>.</p><p>Despite not being a&nbsp;huge place, this refuge in&nbsp;the forest has some <a href=#>luxuries</a> in&nbsp;keeping with the lifestyle of&nbsp;an&nbsp;American football star like a&nbsp;cinema at&nbsp;scale, a&nbsp;barbershop, a&nbsp;two-lane bowling alley, a&nbsp;motor court, two swimming pools, and a&nbsp;rooftop terrace with an&nbsp;area to&nbsp;practice yoga.</p><p><h2>8. Kesha</h2></p><p>Between 2014 and 2015, <a href=#>Kesha</a> lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Spanish-style <a href=#>bungalow</a> of&nbsp;about 1,400 square feet located in&nbsp;Venice Beach. Despite not being a&nbsp;mansion, this place had extraordinary beauty. It&nbsp;was built with a&nbsp;very romantic main room and French doors that led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;secluded patio with an&nbsp;outdoor fireplace.</p><p>The famous singer bought this property for <a href=#>$1,650,000</a> and sold it&nbsp;a&nbsp;year later for over <a href=#>$1,800,000</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9cc/5c8/16ebf45938bec909198d95ecf7.jpg><p><h2>9. Tori Spelling</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;few years ago, this <a href=#>actress</a> and <a href=#>businesswoman</a> who became a&nbsp;star in&nbsp;the ’90s thanks to&nbsp;her role on&nbsp;Beverly Hills, 90210, lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>bungalow</a> with her family. There, she had her own garden where she grew vegetables and fruits. She also had a&nbsp;pet <a href=#>chicken</a> and a&nbsp;<a href=#>pig</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03c/35a/c796285973b38fd5a51d574fb7.jpg><p><h2>10. Warren Buffett</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b33/19f/dfdb9152609a5035562e17a1f3.jpg><p>Despite holding equity valued at&nbsp;approximately $70.5&nbsp;billion, <a href=#>Warren Edward Buffett</a>, Berkshire Hathaway President and CEO, still lives in&nbsp;the same house he&nbsp;bought in&nbsp;1957 for about <a href=#>$31,500</a> (currently valued at&nbsp;more than $600,000). His small mansion located in&nbsp;Omaha, Nebraska is&nbsp;around 65,000 square feet and has 5&nbsp;bedrooms and 2.5&nbsp;bathrooms.</p><p>His house isn’t modest at&nbsp;all, but considering his immense fortune, it’s small. This 89-year-old billionaire could live any place in&nbsp;the world he&nbsp;wanted but has chosen to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the city where he&nbsp;was born.</p><p><h2>11. Tom Shadyac</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a3/bfe/ba0fe554e2a1a68a2affad2954.jpg><p>At&nbsp;first glance, this name may not be&nbsp;well known. Still, <a href=#>Shadyac</a> was he&nbsp;great mind behind famous comedies such as&nbsp;<a href=#>Bruce Almighty</a>, <a href=#>Ace Ventura</a>,<a href=#> Liar, Liar,</a> and <a href=#>The Nutty Professor</a>, among others. This American writer, director, and producer generated much of&nbsp;his fortune between the late 1990s and 2000s, which he&nbsp;then invested in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>mansion</a> of&nbsp;about 17,000 square feet. However, after a&nbsp;bicycle accident that left him with a&nbsp;depressive disorder, he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;revelation. He&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;sell his large house and move to&nbsp;a&nbsp;trailer park.</p><p><h2>12. Lea Michele</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;2012, when the show Glee was at&nbsp;its peak of&nbsp;popularity, the main protagonist of&nbsp;the series, <a href=#>Lea Michele</a>, lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cozy house in&nbsp;Los Angeles that she bought for <a href=#>$1.4&nbsp;million</a>. The property wasn’t huge, but it&nbsp;had its <a href=#>luxuries</a>, such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful marble finish in&nbsp;the kitchen and a&nbsp;solar-heated saltwater pool. The <a href=#>actress</a> lived there until 2015 when she decided to&nbsp;move into a&nbsp;$3-million-dollar mansion that has, among other things, a&nbsp;2-story gym.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f9a/e7c/8fa43152bf9d6ccb7bf8d9ed55.jpg><p><h2>13. Chris Daughtry</h2></p><p>Musician and vocalist <a href=#>Chris Daughtry</a>, who came in&nbsp;fourth place on&nbsp;American Idol, bought a&nbsp;<a href=#>house</a> in&nbsp;North Carolina for $690,000 in&nbsp;2006. This&nbsp;3,782-square-foot <a href=#>property</a> has 4&nbsp;bedrooms and 3&nbsp;and a&nbsp;half bathrooms&nbsp;— and living with his wife and 4&nbsp;children, two of&nbsp;them had to&nbsp;share a&nbsp;room. However, despite not having an&nbsp;individual room for each family member (what a&nbsp;sin for a&nbsp;celebrity, right?), the house did have a&nbsp;saltwater pool, spa, and professional golf course. Finally, in&nbsp;2011, the artist put the property up&nbsp;for sale.</p><p><h2>14. Mark Zuckerberg</h2></p><p>Tech entrepreneur <a href=#>Mark Zuckerberg</a> lives on&nbsp;a&nbsp;$7&nbsp;million <a href=#>property</a>, a&nbsp;price that is&nbsp;not at&nbsp;all low. However, considering that it’s located in&nbsp;Silicon Valley, an&nbsp;excessively expensive region if&nbsp;we’re talking about real estate and taking into account that Zuckerberg is&nbsp;worth around $76.4 billion from Facebook, we&nbsp;can quickly conclude that this house is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;excessive luxury.</p><p>Zuckerberg’s most significant expense is&nbsp;privacy. He&nbsp;spent $30 million buying 4&nbsp;properties surrounding his home just to&nbsp;tear them down and build smaller ones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bdc/f7a/46cf2152e48fe65dceeb265b6d.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you had the fortune that many of&nbsp;these millionaires possess, where would you choose to&nbsp;live?
