One notable event that propelled her into the spotlight was her unexpected appearance on&nbsp;television during the 2002&nbsp;FIFA World Cup.</p><p>This chance exposure led to&nbsp;her debut as&nbsp;a&nbsp;singer, captivating audiences with her beauty and talent. Additionally, her warm and approachable personality has endeared her to&nbsp;fans and colleagues alike.</p><p><h2>She and her husband shocked the public with their marriage.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/116/777/11b6445531b8182fde95f84e01.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprising turn of&nbsp;events, Shim Mina made headlines worldwide with the announcement of&nbsp;her <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> to&nbsp;Ryu Philip, a&nbsp;former member of&nbsp;the boy group SoREAL. Their union, which took place in&nbsp;2018, caused quite a&nbsp;stir, especially considering the significant age gap between them and the fact that Ryu Philip was still in&nbsp;his 20s at&nbsp;the time. The couple’s <a href=# title="love story" data-link=tag>love story</a>, however, captured the hearts of&nbsp;many when Shim Mina candidly shared their journey on&nbsp;the popular&nbsp;TV show, tvN’s TAXI.</p><p><h2>They met in&nbsp;a&nbsp;club.</h2></p><p>Shim Mina and Ryu Philip’s initial meeting occurred in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>club</a>, setting the stage for a&nbsp;tale intertwined with the <strong>complexities of&nbsp;the entertainment industry</strong>. Mina’s company had connections with the Chinese firm managing ZE:A, leading her to&nbsp;become close friends with a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the group. Meanwhile, Ryu Philip’s group, SoREAL, emerged as&nbsp;a&nbsp;junior group from the same company.</p><p>Their paths crossed unexpectedly, highlighting the unpredictable nature of&nbsp;<a href=# title=destiny data-link=tag>destiny</a> and the interconnectedness within the industry. This chance encounter laid the groundwork for a&nbsp;bond that transcended professional affiliations, eventually blossoming into a&nbsp;<a href=# title=romance data-link=tag>romance</a> that culminated in&nbsp;marriage.</p><p><h2>Mina was exactly his type.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef5/aee/96af835fc3a6e80ce0d41a093f.jpg><p>Mina revealed that Ryu Philip took his time to&nbsp;approach her, <strong>waiting a&nbsp;good three to&nbsp;four hours</strong> into the party before striking up&nbsp;a&nbsp;conversation. With a&nbsp;casual touch on&nbsp;her waist, he&nbsp;engaged her in&nbsp;lively chatter.</p><p>As&nbsp;the evening drew to&nbsp;a&nbsp;close, he&nbsp;extended an&nbsp;invitation to&nbsp;meet again the following day. Mina accepted&nbsp;it, inviting him to&nbsp;join her and her friends at&nbsp;her house. It&nbsp;was during this gathering that Ryu Philip confessed Mina was exactly his type, sparking the beginning of&nbsp;their romantic journey together.</p><p><h2>People insult Mina but her husband protects her.</h2></p><p>He&nbsp;stayed calm amidst the insults directed at&nbsp;Mina, protecting her without acknowledging any age difference. One of&nbsp;the hurtful remarks aimed at&nbsp;Mina said that Mina will never have the body of&nbsp;a&nbsp;20-year-old. No&nbsp;matter how hard she tries.</p><p>Her husband <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disagrees</a>. Ryu says that Mina<strong> doesn’t maintain her physique to&nbsp;resemble that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;20-year-old</strong>; it’s for her well-being. While he&nbsp;hasn’t dated anyone else in&nbsp;their 50s, he&nbsp;can confidently say that Mina’s physical condition surpasses many in&nbsp;their 20s. He&nbsp;encourages prioritizing health, so&nbsp;that you may achieve a&nbsp;similar level of&nbsp;fitness in&nbsp;the future.</p><p>Ryu garnered praise for handling the disrespectful remarks with patience and dignity, displaying maturity in&nbsp;his rebuttals. Others were also touched by&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>defense</a> of&nbsp;Mina, expressing hopes that the couple would be&nbsp;spared from future unwarranted criticism.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;world where ageist and body-shaming remarks often echo louder than words of&nbsp;support, the story of&nbsp;Ryu and Mina emerges as&nbsp;a&nbsp;beacon of&nbsp;resilience and <a href=#>love</a>. Their bond, tested by&nbsp;the sharp tongues of&nbsp;critics, has weathered the storm of&nbsp;derogatory comments with unwavering strength and grace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCpsdJmbGxlmJrAbn%2BVZqKoqpWWu26vxKWcm6qZqcZuv9OapZ2rXZu8s3nHoqpmr5mbsm6txpqgp6ukYq6oscispGZwYW19eIKO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
