Some fans have spotted social media clues pointing to the 18-year-old joining the show. However, it wouldn’t be Rylee’s first time in the ballroom.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-think-rylee-arnold-is-joining-dancing-with-the-stars>Fans Think Rylee Arnold Is Joining Dancing with the Stars</h2><p>Last week, Lindsay Arnold <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">took to social media</a> to tell fans that she won’t be returning as a pro for the upcoming season of DWTS. However, the dancer teased that she’ll still be connected to Season 32 in some way.</p><p>“That’s not to say that I’m not gonna be having some fun connections to this season,” Lindsay teased fans. “I’m not gonna say anything other than that. But I’m very excited for this next season.”</p><p>Not long after Lindsay made this announcement, fans on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Reddit</a> noticed a post from her and Rylee’s mom Mindy sharing that she and Rylee were “off with a very full car.” They didn’t say where they were going, but more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>recent posts</a> suggest that Rylee may have moved to Los Angeles.</p><p>According to insider Kristyn Burtt, there <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">will be no troupe</a> for the upcoming season. This has led some fans to believe that Rylee is joining the show as a pro dancer to be partnered with a celebrity contestant.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LINDSAY ARNOLD RETURNS TO BALLROOM DANCING WITH BRANDON ARMSTRONG</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rylee-appeared-on-dwts-juniors>Rylee Appeared on DWTS: Juniors</h2><p>Technically, Rylee wouldn’t be totally new to the Dancing with the Stars family. Not only did her sister appear as a pro for several seasons, but she herself was also a pro dancer on DWTS: Juniors back in 2018.</p><p>Rylee was partnered with Black-ish star Miles Brown, with Lindsay serving as their mentor.
