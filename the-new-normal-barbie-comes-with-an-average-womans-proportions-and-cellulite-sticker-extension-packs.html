(<a href=# rel=noopener>Were Barbie human</a>, she’d have to walk on all fours because of her tiny feet and because she would only have room for half a liver.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That’s why graphic designer turned toymaker Nickolay Lamm created the Lammily doll — what the Barbie would look like if she actually had the measurements of an average 19-year-old woman’s body (based on CDC data). And brown hair. (She also comes with a sticker-extension pack, complete with cellulite, freckles and acne, but we’ll get to that later.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What started as an <a href=# rel=noopener>art project in July 2013</a> became <a href=# rel=noopener>available for purchase and delivery Wednesday</a>. “Parents and their kids were emailing and asking where they could buy the ‘normal Barbie’ — but they didn’t exist,” Lamm, 26, tells TIME. And so he decided to <a href=# rel=noopener>crowdfund his creation</a>, raising $501,000 for his $95,000 target goal. “To be honest, I knew it was either going to bomb or blow up, there was no in between,” Lamm says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lamm also created a video that transforms a Lammily doll into a Barbie to really get his point across:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I wanted to show that reality is cool,” Lamm says. “And a lot of toys make kids go into fantasy, but why don’t they show real life is cool? It’s not perfect, but it’s really all we have. And that’s awesome.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But real proportions and movement weren’t enough. Before putting the $24.99 dolls on sale — 19,000 dolls are going to backers, but 25,000 more are ready to be shipped before the holidays — Lamm decided to take things a step further.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Enter the $5.99 sticker-extension pack, available in January. Lamm says it took four months to find the proper sticker material, that gives the doll’s face acne, freckles, moles and the ability to blush:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-19-at-1-55-30-am.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-19-at-2-03-06-am.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-19-at-1-57-11-am.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lamm also decided to include scrapes and bruises. “Some people were like ‘Oh my God,’ as if I’m promoting domestic violence or something,” says Lamm, before assuring TIME that that was far from his intention. “Look, we all get boo boos and scratches. Life isn’t perfect, we all sometimes fall down but we get back up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-19-at-2-01-24-am.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lamm’s aunt recommended he add scars, he says, “because, you know, some kids have scars and are really shy about them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-19-at-3-36-03-am.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But then there’s the cellulite and the stretch marks:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-19-at-2-00-12-am.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-19-at-3-36-50-am.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Unleashing a doll with stretch marks on the Internet is basically asking for trouble. But Lamm insists that it came from a sincere place, and that some people will welcome the option. “Demi Lovato even tweeted about it,” he says:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Also, Barbie should make dolls with cellulite!!! Hahaha!!! After all, around 95% of ALL women have it!!! 😝😊</p>— Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) <a href=#>June 10, 2013</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You know, people were saying this whole project was a joke from the beginning, so I have no doubt some people will take it as a joke,” Lamm says. “But I hope there are enough people who believe what I believe. I think 25% to 30% will think the stickers are stupid and the rest will think it’s good.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Lammily will have other fashion options in January:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-19-at-3-52-05-am.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This is the doll people have been waiting for,” Lamm says. Stretch marks and all.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>See More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Watch Little Girls React to the Realistic Barbie Alternative</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read next: <a href=# rel=noopener>New GoldieBlox Doll Takes Aim at ‘Barbie’ Beauty Standards</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbWlohneEjq2fnmWemsRuus6rpJqkXZeus67InmScp52awG7DyK2fZpmeYq63sdGanp5lp6S6orrSZqerp6Ckv7W1zqeqZpmemXqksculrKWhpJp6tMDInKKeql2axbWxzaygqKZdpa6kt9Jo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
