They both stem from the same Germanic language family, which also includes Norwegian and Danish. Despite its shared lineage with German, modern English has branched away from its Germanic roots and evolved into a unique blend of many languages, including Latin, French and Spanish.&nbsp;</p><p>But quite a few English words still evince German origins.

Let’s dive into the fascinating ways German has shaped the English vocabulary.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=German-words-or-expressions-commonly-used-in-English>German words or expressions commonly used in English</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Kindergarten</h3><p><strong>Origin: </strong>The English word “kindergarten” comes directly from the German words Kinder (children) and Garten (garden). It was first coined by German pedagogue Friedrich Fröbel in the 19th century to describe his vision for early childhood education, which involved play and activity-based learning environments.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “My youngest child just started kindergarten, and she’s already bringing home colorful crafts and stories each day.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Wanderlust</h3><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The English word “wanderlust” is formed from the German words wandern (to hike or roam) and Lust (desire), reflecting a strong desire to travel and explore the world. It was adopted into English usage in the early 20th century.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “Feeling a surge of wanderlust, he booked a one-way ticket to Berlin, eager to immerse himself in its rich history and vibrant culture.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Schadenfreude</h3><p><strong>Origin: “</strong>Schadenfreude” combines the words Schaden (harm) and Freude (joy), and it describes pleasure derived from someone else’s misfortune.

Doppelgänger</h3><p><strong>Origin: </strong>The term “doppelgänger” combines the German words doppel (double) and Gänger (walker or goer) to form a compound noun that was often used in German folklore to describe a ghostly double of a living person. It was integrated into English in the 19th century, highlighting the universal fascination with doubles and look-alikes.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“When I moved to the new city, I was surprised to meet someone who was my doppelgänger; we even shared the same birthday!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Gesundheit</h3><p><strong>Origin:</strong> “Gesundheit,” meaning health, is used in German as a wish for good health after someone sneezes, similar to the English exclamation, “Bless you!”.
