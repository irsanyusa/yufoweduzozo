Le Corbusier</h2><p>Born in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">1887</a> in La Chaux-de-Fonds, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Le Corbusier</a> went on to become one of the most famous and influential Modernist architects in the world. However, his artistic talents were even more wide-ranging. He was also a sculptor and painter renowned for creating enamels and tapestries. Seventeen of his projects are on the UNESCO World Heritage List, including the stunning Villa Le Lac on Lake Geneva and La Tourette near Lyon.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Albert-Einstein>2. Albert Einstein</h2><p>Although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein</a> was born in neighboring Germany, he lived in Switzerland for many years and even gained Swiss citizenship in 1901. He developed his famous theory of relativity in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bern</a> in 1905. Before this, he also studied in Zurich and later reflected on his years there as some of the happiest of his life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Ursula-Andress>3. Ursula Andress</h2><p>Turning now to show business, we have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ursula Andress</a>. This <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German-speaking</a> Swiss actress captured hearts globally when she starred opposite Sean Connery as the first Bond girl in the 1962 spy film Dr. No. Andress became a pin-up icon and went on to star in other movies through the 1960s and 1970s, including Woody Allen’s 1965 screwball comedy What’s New Pussycat?.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Jean-Jacques-Rousseau>4.

Born in Geneva in 1712, Rousseau was interested in political philosophy and moral psychology. He focused a great deal of his intellectual energy on the idea of preserving human freedom.&nbsp;</p><p>Two of Rousseau’s most famous works, Émile and The Social Contract, were condemned in Geneva for religious heterodoxy. In response, Rousseau gave up his citizenship and fled the country to escape arrest.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Johanna-Spyri>5. Johanna Spyri</h2><p>Author <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johanna Spyri</a>’s fame is often eclipsed by that of her best-known fictional character, Heidi.

Martina Hingis</h2><p>At number seven, we have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Martina Hingis</a>, one of Switzerland’s most famous tennis players.

He is also multilingual and speaks <a href=#>German</a>, French and English.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9.-Martha-Gosteli>9. Martha Gosteli</h2><p>Born in 1917 in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">canton</a> of Bern, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gosteli</a> is one of Switzerland’s most famous feminists. She campaigned tirelessly for women’s suffrage at a federal level in Switzerland, which was finally granted in 1971 (Switzerland was the last country in Europe to grant women the right to vote!).
