I care too deeply about our role in supporting free expression and intellectual diversity to even whole-heartedly attempt the product stuff anymore, and that's how I know it's time to go."</p><p>In the message, seen by Business Insider, he said he is starting a company with his friend "at the intersection of applied philosophy epistemology, specifically) and technology."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Silicon Valley, the heart of the American tech industry, is largely liberal, and has been fraught with allegations of bias in Trump's America.</p><p>In July 2017, Google found itself at the center of a political firestorm after engineer James Damore wrote an internal post decrying what he characterised as "Google's Ideological Echo Chamber," in which he attacked the company's diversity efforts.
