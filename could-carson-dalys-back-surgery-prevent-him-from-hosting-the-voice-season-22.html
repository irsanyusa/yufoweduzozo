He shared that he has now found relief to his decades-long back pain after undergoing his latest back surgery.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-carson-daly-s-history-of-back-pain>Carson Daly’s History of Back Pain</h2><p>Much of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daly</a>‘s back pain was caused by a&nbsp;T12 compression fracture&nbsp;that he sustained in a snowmobile accident in the 1990s. Doctors told him that nothing in his spine was severed, but that the pain was coming from “within the vertebrae.” The 49-year-old host previously underwent a new minimally invasive, FDA-approved procedure&nbsp;called Intracept.</p><p>During the procedure, the doctor uses a probe&nbsp;to deliver targeted radiofrequency energy to stop the basivertebral nerve from carrying pain signals to the brain.&nbsp;Daly revealed that Intracept was not really the cure he was hoping for it to be. Claiming that “(Intracept) is a great option for some, but wasn’t the ‘home run’ I was desperate for.”</p><p>The Intracept procedure was proven to be unsuccessful in eliminating his back pains. This prompted Daly to look for a different method, and that’s when he tried Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion. ALIF is “A type of spinal fusion that utilizes an anterior approach to fuse the lumbar spine bones together.” All information about ALIF is according to the University of Southern California Spine Center. Afterward, he told fans&nbsp;on Instagram&nbsp;that the procedure was a success.</p><p>“On Tuesday morning I underwent successful ALIF back surgery. (Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion) at L5 S1,” he captioned on the post featuring a photo of him with Tiger Woods. “It’s the same operation my SoCal junior golfing buddy&nbsp;Tiger Woods&nbsp;had in 2017. We’re basically the same person.”</p><p>Daly seems to be genuinely happy about how it turned out, signifying that it was a lot better than the previous operation. He ended the post with “I’m very grateful. Next up, the road to recovery. Also, like Tiger, I plan on winning the Master’s in exactly 2 yrs.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will Carson Daly be Able to Host The Voice this Fall?</h2><p>It is good news that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice</a> host Daly is currently on the road to recovery. We as fans wish him a speedy recovery in time for the show’s season 22 premiere. The bones will take 6 months to a year to fuse, and his recovery will be at least 6 to 12 weeks, according to the host. Which does not bode well, as the show is set to air on September 19.</p><p>Nevertheless, Daly is still set to host the show’s upcoming season. Though there is still a possibility that the host will choose to skip the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Live Playoffs</a> this season in favor of his health. Will the longtime host brave out an entire season with an unhealed back? Or will he choose to sit this one out to fully heal himself? We can only know in the weeks to come.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_UsTheDuo_AGT_Jon-Kopaloff_FilmMagic.jpg alt="Us The Duo Spices Up ‘Ghost’ Rendition Through Dope Remix — What Are They Up To Now?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>carson daly</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqispZxdmK6zv86nZJ2ZnK7Abq7AnKJmq6WntKa%2B2Ganq52mmru1eceipGaeoqS6brTOrKuippdiwamxjK%2BmopuVYsCmrdKopWZqYmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
