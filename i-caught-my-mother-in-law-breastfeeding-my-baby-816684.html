Some find that having a&nbsp;child strengthens family bonds, while others might face ongoing conflicts with relatives—just like what happened to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Reddit user, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>SammyandMe35</a> who caught her mother-in-law sneakily <a href=# title=breastfeeding data-link=tag>breastfeeding</a> his newborn baby.</p><p>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;single father who was mourning the loss of&nbsp;his wife Anne, 34, shortly after the birth of&nbsp;their first child Sammy. He&nbsp;has captured the internet’s attention with his recent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a>.</p><p>"I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;widower. I&nbsp;lost my&nbsp;wife (Anne&nbsp;34) just minutes after she gave birth to&nbsp;our first baby (Sammy). She had a&nbsp;difficult pregnancy so&nbsp;I took an&nbsp;indefinite leave 3&nbsp;months before she was due. Sammy’s 4&nbsp;months old now and before&nbsp;I went back to&nbsp;work, I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;MIL (Sandra&nbsp;56) about my&nbsp;plans and if&nbsp;she can recommend a&nbsp;nanny to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter when I&nbsp;work. She offered to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it (nanny) for free.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ecc/bc2/ae6f4e57b09a41c850dabd164f.jpg><p>"I&nbsp;told her she’s free to&nbsp;come by&nbsp;anytime during the day if&nbsp;she feels uncomfortable with a&nbsp;nanny looking after Sammy but she insisted on&nbsp;doing it&nbsp;herself. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;said yes and gave her a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;the house keys. She comes 30&nbsp;mins. before&nbsp;I leave for work, and when&nbsp;I come home, she stays for dinner and leaves after putting Sammy to&nbsp;sleep.</p><p>"Everything was fine for the first couple of&nbsp;weeks until&nbsp;I noticed that Sammy’s not feeding as&nbsp;much. Her formula’s barely touched. I&nbsp;asked Sandra about it&nbsp;and why Sammy’s not feeding well. She said she’s trying to&nbsp;breastfeed my&nbsp;daughter.</p><p>"At&nbsp;first&nbsp;I thought she was joking then&nbsp;I realized she wasn’t. She said Sammy needs to&nbsp;latch for a&nbsp;few minutes everyday to&nbsp;“activate” her milk production. I&nbsp;almost lost&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;told her she cannot do&nbsp;that, and she needs to&nbsp;stop.</p><p>"She said she will but&nbsp;I caught her again when&nbsp;I walked in&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter’s room and she was forcing Sammy to&nbsp;latch. I&nbsp;confronted her and told her she’s no&nbsp;longer my&nbsp;baby’s nanny. I&nbsp;didn’t ask for the key back as&nbsp;she is&nbsp;still welcome to&nbsp;come visit anytime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d7/618/34bc7053e8af5928861c1a2c43.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;asked for a&nbsp;one week leave from work to&nbsp;care for my&nbsp;daughter and find a&nbsp;nanny. I&nbsp;found one but two days after she never returned. I&nbsp;called her and she said my&nbsp;“Mother” fired her the day before. I&nbsp;asked her to&nbsp;describe the woman and&nbsp;I was livid when&nbsp;I realized it&nbsp;was Sandra. She came in&nbsp;my&nbsp;house using her key and fired my&nbsp;nanny.</p><p>“I&nbsp;was about to&nbsp;call her when she showed up&nbsp;and said a&nbsp;convoluted story like how&nbsp;I hired an&nbsp;incompetent nanny, etc. etc. I&nbsp;told her to&nbsp;leave but she refused and told me&nbsp;she’s calling CPS because I&nbsp;am endangering my&nbsp;child. We&nbsp;argued back and forth before&nbsp;I called the police and she was charged with trespassing.</p><p>I&nbsp;know my&nbsp;MIL&nbsp;is grieving the loss of&nbsp;her daughter, I&nbsp;am too. But she crossed the line when she disregarded my&nbsp;wishes. She is&nbsp;very upset with&nbsp;me. My&nbsp;SIL and BIL are calling me&nbsp;ruthless and I&nbsp;am now second guessing myself. Have I&nbsp;taken it&nbsp;too far by&nbsp;calling the police?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/ef7/710/a7708b518e9d2a4c01b31483fd.jpeg><p>Many people in&nbsp;the comments were on&nbsp;Redditor’s side, with one comment <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “Her trying to&nbsp;breastfeed your daughter without your permission is&nbsp;gross and completely wrong. Beyond that she FIRED YOUR NANNY? I’d ask for your key back and set some serious boundaries.”</p><p>Another users also suggested that he&nbsp;install more security for his house. “Change the locks. With the way she was hurdling over the boundaries you set, I&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;surprised if&nbsp;she made copies. And make sure to&nbsp;tell the nanny not to&nbsp;let anyone&nbsp;in,” user Rogue_Darkholme <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>. “All of&nbsp;this and install cameras around your home immediately!” user RandomLee37&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>.</p><p>Parenthood can change how your family works. Some families get closer, but others might have ongoing issues with relatives. For instance, there was a&nbsp;mother-in-law who got into an&nbsp;argument because she wanted <a href=#>payment </a>for spending time with her grandchild.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZur8CunqGsXaLGbrnOrZ%2Beql2eu264wLBkm6qVlsC1ssSem6Kml2K6unnBmpmyZWhmg3eEk2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
