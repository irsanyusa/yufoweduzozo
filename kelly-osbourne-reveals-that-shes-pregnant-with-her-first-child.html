She took to social media to share two photos of herself posing with ultrasound prints. Osbourne tagged her boyfriend, Slipknot member, Sid Wilson within the photos.</p><p>“I know that I have been very quiet these past few months so I thought I would share with you all as to why… I am over the moon to announce that I am going to be a Mumma,” Osbourne wrote. “To say that I am happy does not quite cut it. I am ecstatic!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Cdd3R9kpIQ1/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Following Osbourne’s announcement, Wilson shared another ultrasound photo to his <a href=#>Instagram page</a>. The caption of his post was a series of emojis featuring hearts and a family. The couple’s announcement has been met with tons of love and support from their friends and family members.</p><p>One of the most notable social media reactions was from none other than former <a href=#>AGT</a> judge Sharon Osbourne. She re-posted her daughter’s selfie to her own page with an adorable caption.</p><p>“My heart could not be more full! So excited to share the beautiful journey ahead with you,” She wrote.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-osbourne-and-sid-wilson-s-dating-timeline>Kelly Osbourne and Sid Wilson’s Dating Timeline</h2><p>This couple reportedly first met in 1999 through the music scene. They met while Slipknot was touring as part of Ozzfest, the music festival founded by Osbourne’s parents, Ozzy and Sharon. Recent sources confirmed that they remained friends following this festival.</p><p>After being friends for nearly 23 years, Osborne announced that she was dating the metal star in early 2022. Reports state that the couple made it official when Osbourne shared a few photos of Wilson for his 45th birthday last January. Shortly after, sources confirmed that they were “<a href=#>very happy</a> together.”</p><p>They were later seen gushing about one another in their Valentine’s Day posts. Osbourne shared that Wilson was not only her boyfriend, but also her best friend and soulmate within her caption. Within Wilson’s post he noted his deep love for her. Since then, their romance has remained relatively private.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1390571756-1.jpg alt="‘AGT’s Howie Mandel Says He Got Covid-19 at the Kids’ Choice Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>kelly osbourne</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdpMCju9SrpZ5loprDpq3LrGStoJGperS0xKxkqaqVnLuiutNmrqKsmGK1pr6Mn6Crq6RisKm1y51m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
