Their love story can’t be&nbsp;called flawless, but they proved that through enduring difficulties you can reach harmony. This was perfectly explained in&nbsp;Legend’s song “All of&nbsp;Me,” which he&nbsp;dedicated to&nbsp;his wife. The couple has been together for a&nbsp;decade, and they now have a&nbsp;daughter, <strong>Luna</strong> (born in&nbsp;2016), and another baby on&nbsp;the way.</p><p><h2>Kim Kardashian and Kanye West</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fea/338/dd77d151d0be95d9e82638497e.jpg><p>The life of&nbsp;this couple is&nbsp;constantly under the scrutiny of&nbsp;the media with the paparazzi trying to&nbsp;snap a&nbsp;pic of&nbsp;their every move.

The story of&nbsp;their acquaintance is&nbsp;living proof that fairy tales exist. She was a&nbsp;hostess at&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant her soon-to-be husband once visited. The funniest thing, as&nbsp;she admitted herself, was that she didn’t recognize him at&nbsp;first and even brushed him off as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was really annoying.

Prior to&nbsp;being his wife, she was the adopted daughter of&nbsp;Mia Farrow&nbsp;— whom he&nbsp;was dating at&nbsp;that time. Later, Woody admitted he&nbsp;never expected this fling to&nbsp;turn into something serious. Even though a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;sexual assault and molestation scandals involving Previn were made public by&nbsp;Mia Farrow, the couple finally got married in&nbsp;Venice on&nbsp;December&nbsp;23, 1997, and adopted 2&nbsp;children&nbsp;— <strong>Bechet</strong> and <strong>Manzie</strong>.</p><p><h2>George Lucas and Mellody Hobson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b1/01b/bc184f50c3abe548bf7d2e4110.jpg><p>American filmmaker and producer <strong>George Lucas,</strong> best known as&nbsp;the creator of&nbsp;the epic Star Wars saga and Indiana Jones franchise, and businesswoman <strong>Mellody Hobson</strong> met at&nbsp;a&nbsp;business conference.

This whirlwind romance started in&nbsp;May 2015 in&nbsp;Rome before the first match in&nbsp;the Italian Open. The first encounter wasn’t absolutely flawless as&nbsp;Serena tried to&nbsp;get him to&nbsp;leave by&nbsp;saying there was a&nbsp;rat nearby, but, luckily, Alexis took it&nbsp;with humor, which definitely lit a&nbsp;spark. The pair kept quiet throughout 2015, and it&nbsp;was only in&nbsp;November 2016 that Serena posted their first photo and made their relationship official.</p><p>And how did you meet your other half?
