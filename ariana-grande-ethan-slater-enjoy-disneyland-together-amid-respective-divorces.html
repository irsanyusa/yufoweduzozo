Recently, the pop singer and the Broadway star are spotted enjoying Disneyland alongside their loved ones.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ariana-grande-ethan-slater-visited-disneyland-with-pals>Ariana Grande, Ethan Slater Visited Disneyland with Pals</h2><p>Last week, the new couple indulged in the corners of Disneyland along with their close friends. A source close to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pop singer</a> shared that the two are happy and compatible with each other.</p><p>“They went with a big group of friends including Ariana’s mom and brother,” the source said. “They are really happy and really good for each other. All of her friends love him.”</p><p>In the photos shared by celebrity gossip page DeuxMoi, Grande was seen strolling next to Slater. The pictures also show the couple linking arms while dressing down for their night at the amusement park.</p><p>The Broadway star was donning a black hooded sweatshirt paired with black baggy sweatpants. For her part, Grande sported a black hoodie matched with a pleated skirt and black shoes.</p><p>Last week, September 18, Grande <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from ex Dalton Gomez. The real estate broker filed in the same day as well. As per documents obtained by TMZ, the singer’s lawyer, Laura Wasser, “irreconcilable differences” was the reason for their divorce, listing February 20, 2023, as the date of separation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Slater filed for divorce from his estranged wife Lilly Jay back in July, leaving her “devastated.” Speaking to DailyMail, Jay stated that she’s now been looking at the positive side and focusing on their baby boy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-are-reportedly-living-together-in-new-york>They Are Reportedly Living Together in New York</h2><p>As Grande and Slater brew their romance stronger, the two have reportedly taken their relationship to the next level. After their secret romance was revealed, the pair has reportedly been “stuck together.”</p><p>“Ariana is living with a married man right now while she is still married,” a source close to the situation said. “It seems as if Ariana is holding onto Dalton in case things with Ethan don’t work. It is just so strange that she is living with Ethan and has not filed documents to end it with Dalton.”</p><p>The alleged lovers met in December 2022 on the UK set of Broadway musical <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wicked</a>. People magazine once reported that Grande and Slater were “strictly friends” until they separated from their respective spouses.</p><p>Subsequently though, another source claimed that such statements were “absolutely untrue” as there were “receipts” to prove the otherwise. According to the same insider, the Grande and Slater “never intended for their relationship to go public.” However, such wasn’t possible anymore are they got caught.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_JordanFisher_Bruce-GlikasWireImage-220x167.jpeg alt="‘DWTS’ Winner Jordan Fisher Details How He Bonds With His Son Through Music" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKugmqaRYrSzrc2dnGadpJ2ur3nSpZitnaJisq%2B2zrJknaGjo7K6uMCnm2asn5yytbTEq2SapZmZerOx0qmcnKyZq7JusMivpqublah8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
