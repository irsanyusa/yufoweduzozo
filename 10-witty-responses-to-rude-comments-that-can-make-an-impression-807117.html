These situations leave&nbsp;us feeling uncomfortable and wondering which response is&nbsp;right. The good news is&nbsp;there are many ways to&nbsp;stand up&nbsp;for yourself without coming off as&nbsp;offensive or&nbsp;aggressive, and without letting their words get under your skin.</p><p>The <strong>Bright Side</strong> team has put together a&nbsp;guide for you to&nbsp;deal with unthoughtful comments and establish firm boundaries with people in&nbsp;a&nbsp;subtle yet assertive way.</p><p><h2>1. Answer with a&nbsp;question.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b98/b03/568d745af3983127f54d6f2569.jpg><p>Answering a&nbsp;question with a&nbsp;question is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the oldest tactics in&nbsp;the book to&nbsp;change the topic. In&nbsp;addition, acting concerned about the rude person’s behavior will remind them that they are the ones with problems to&nbsp;solve and that their aggressiveness is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;mere reflection of&nbsp;their insecurities.</p><p><h2>2. Say, “Thank you.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f01/f8f/3535bd5543ba0fb776d4518ba8.jpg><p>While it&nbsp;sounds counterintuitive to&nbsp;answer a&nbsp;rude comment with a&nbsp;“thank you,” this answer is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most effective ways to&nbsp;end this unwanted conversation. When you respond with a&nbsp;“thank you,” you acknowledge their sincerity without letting their harsh words get under your skin.</p><p><h2>3. Acknowledge the concern.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c31/70e/070e825cee946ba8ed92b74190.jpg><p>Often, people we&nbsp;love comment on&nbsp;our looks from a&nbsp;place of&nbsp;love. Little do&nbsp;they know, their words are wounding&nbsp;us on&nbsp;a&nbsp;deeper level. That’s why establishing healthy boundaries is&nbsp;the ultimate way to&nbsp;save the relationship and keep both parties satisfied.</p><p>Though you acknowledge that they are coming from a&nbsp;good place, you can let them know that their words are still hurtful regardless. This way, they’ll learn to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more careful with their remarks in&nbsp;the future.</p><p><h2>4. Tell them that their words are of&nbsp;no&nbsp;help.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a66/2db/68815e5058a9c9520bfb79df89.jpg><p>Receiving constructive feedback is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most effective methods to&nbsp;improve our skills. But sometimes, many people sugarcoat their mean ideas and present them as&nbsp;constructive feedback. An&nbsp;effective way to&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;their words is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make them realize that you understood what they said. Later, tell them that their words aren’t helping to&nbsp;insinuate the fact that passive-aggressive <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> is&nbsp;rarely effective.</p><p><h2>5. Say, “I&nbsp;appreciate your perspective.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f42/a2a/4d494d55f3a35695484a70c4c0.jpg><p>Being honest is&nbsp;certainly a&nbsp;precious trait, yet many people use the “I&nbsp;tell it&nbsp;how it&nbsp;is” card to&nbsp;tear people down with their unsolicited opinions. The response, “I&nbsp;appreciate your perspective,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shows</a> how intelligent and mature you are since you responded civilly and didn’t let them drag you down. After all, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day, being honest is&nbsp;about being respectful and considerate.</p><p><h2>6. Say, “Okay.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/22b/564/f4026a571189abd288b0a287cd.jpg><p>Taking someone’s backhanded compliments too seriously isn’t always the smartest thing to&nbsp;do. It’s possible that the person who gives them doesn’t know how to&nbsp;deal with their own feelings, or&nbsp;maybe they’re deliberately trying to&nbsp;hurt you. So&nbsp;acknowledge that you heard what they said with a&nbsp;firm “okay” and move on&nbsp;with your day.</p><p><h2>7. Call them out.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/618/750/31430d50e2b7e986b981b301f2.jpg><p>Many of&nbsp;us were thought to&nbsp;be&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;people and avoid unnecessary confrontations at&nbsp;all costs. But sometimes, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;best to&nbsp;call a&nbsp;spade a&nbsp;spade. By&nbsp;calling a&nbsp;rude person out, especially when they have a&nbsp;history of&nbsp;impertinence, you let them know that you see what they are doing and refuse to&nbsp;allow them to&nbsp;have power over your mood or&nbsp;actions. By&nbsp;disengaging from the conversation, they will understand that you won’t stoop to&nbsp;their level, no&nbsp;matter how hard they push.</p><p><h2>8. Embrace what they said.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b32/467/d9446f5fab9b9414b4aaf9dbf5.jpg><p>How people treat other people is&nbsp;a&nbsp;direct reflection of&nbsp;how they feel about themselves.</p><p>This answer is&nbsp;effective when someone is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;shame you about your feelings. Comments like, “You’re so&nbsp;sensitive,” or&nbsp;“You’re so&nbsp;dramatic,” are undoubtedly dismissive and condescending. Reminding them that you are in&nbsp;allegiance with your emotions and are comfortable expressing your feelings shows a&nbsp;high level of&nbsp;maturity and emotional intelligence.</p><p><h2>9. Be&nbsp;sacrastic.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca5/cfb/55260258218fab8d33a613c6f1.jpg><p>Even if&nbsp;it’s slightly sarcastic, it&nbsp;shows the other person that you’re choosing not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;affected by&nbsp;their toxic negativity. A&nbsp;sarcastic reply will also let rude people know that you are not an&nbsp;easy target, discouraging them from making other disrespectful remarks.</p><p><h2>10. Ask them to&nbsp;repeat and explain what they said.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/845/167/a8cadf5356a3374335aab00f35.jpg><p>Whenever someone insults you, pretend that you didn’t hear or&nbsp;understand what they said. Politely ask them to&nbsp;repeat themselves.</p><p>Even when they repeat it&nbsp;word for word, ask them to&nbsp;explain what they mean. This way, the situation will get awkward, and they will feel embarrassed. Hopefully, they’ll recognize their mistake and try to&nbsp;rectify the situation.</p><p>When someone is&nbsp;rude, keep a&nbsp;smile on&nbsp;your face. When you stay on&nbsp;the high road and keep your joy, you take away their power.</p><p>What’s your favorite comeback? What is&nbsp;the worst backhanded compliment you’ve been given, and how did you respond?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xedaiq62xXaeytLzOp6qeq12pvG6%2B1J2cZpuforqmutOsZK2gkal6pK3NZqSao5Virq95yKanq52jqLawuoxxZ3BpYWx8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
