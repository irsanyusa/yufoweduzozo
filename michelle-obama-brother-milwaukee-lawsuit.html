More than 200 USM parents, students and alumni signed a <a href=# rel=noopener>petition</a>, calling on the school to take action to change a “culture of bias and insensitivity.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And around the country, many Black families have withdrawn their children from public and private schools, some <a href=# rel=noopener>turning to homeschooling</a> in an effort to combat whitewashed history lessons and racism in school. Homeschooling increased nationwide after the pandemic disrupted in-person learning, most significantly among Black families, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Robinsons said they will donate any money they receive as part of the lawsuit toward programs aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in schools.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaWZufnGBjqagnKCVobmmec6bmKaZXZe%2FsMDHnqlmpZmhxKLByp6cZqSRrMC2tdNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
