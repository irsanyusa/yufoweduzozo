That can help you decide whether you need to be actively worried about ghosts or not. The database has 4.5 million houses in it so far, according to Bloomberg Business, and customers have bought 30,000 house searches.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Most people would want to know if someone had been murdered in a house they’re about to buy, but many states have lax laws about disclosing deaths and crimes to future buyers. Pennsylvania and Massachusetts law don’t require disclosure of former crimes on the property, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Massachusetts law</a> even says that “alleged supernatural phenomenon” don’t need to be disclosed in a real estate transaction. By contrast, South Dakota and Alaska require would-be buyers to be appraised of any murders or suicides on the property in the last 12 months, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Bloomberg.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In some high-profile cases, addresses are changed to conceal the morbid history of a home. That was the case with 755 15th St in Boulder Colorado, which was changed to <a href=# rel=noopener>749 15th St ten years after 6-year old JonBenet Ramsey</a> was murdered there in 1996. But a representative from DiedInHouse says it has updated both addresses, so that future buyers know the history of the home.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtaGhqg3aAjp2gnpyZo7WwwdKeZJqooGKxpq3ToWSanJSnsrS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
