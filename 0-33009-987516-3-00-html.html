The potential connection between global warming and the increased frequency of El Ninos in recent decades was taken directly from peer-reviewed scientific articles. Attempts to educate the public about science should be based on true scientific understanding, and not on subjective journalistic whim. ERIC SANFORD, Ph.D. candidate Department of Zoology Oregon State University Corvallis, Ore.</p><p>I must agree with Krauthammer that the El Nino phenomenon is being blamed for things that it has nothing to do with. Instead of focusing on the hype and rhetoric surrounding El Nino, the U.S. should reflect on the underlying causes of global warming and cooperate to slow or eliminate them. If they fail to do this, humanity will be headed toward a disaster of biblical proportions. By burning the rain forests, freely using fossil fuels and increasing the pollution from motor vehicles, mankind may one day create a hell on earth, where fertile regions, such as lush tropical rain forests, become uninhabitable deserts. CHRISTIAN ZALAI London, Ont.</p><p>It is misguided to say there is no link between global warming and recent anomalous El Nino behavior. El Nino is certainly a natural phenomenon, but it occurs because there is a need to move heat out of the tropical Pacific Ocean, where it would otherwise build up. Because global warming caused by increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere disturbs the heat balance, it affects El Nino. The behavior of El Nino in the past 20 years is statistically very unusual compared with that of the previous 100 years. Determining exactly which part of this unusual behavior is connected to global warming is still a scientific challenge, but that there is a connection should not be in doubt. KEVIN E.

If Hillary is the First Lady, then Bob Dole should become the First Gentleman. Besides being the correct successor to First Lady, it would be quite appropriate for Bob Dole. But I suspect the press won't like it. First Husband, perhaps? RUFFORD HARRISON Washington, N.H.</p><p>CASINOS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS</p><p>I found your article on casino marketing and the use of player reward and recognition cards insulting [BUSINESS, Nov. 17]. It is unfair and inaccurate to assume that the people who participate in casino player programs have gambling problems. I fail to understand why a recreational activity that is enjoyed responsibly by millions of healthy and normal Americans was so maligned. The vast majority of those who enjoy recreational casino entertainment are highly intelligent, successful and personable people anyone would be proud to know. Our customers deserve more respect than you gave them. PHILIP G. SATRE Chairman, President and CEO Harrah's Entertainment Inc.
