In a leaked audition from Tuesday night’s episode, Simon Cowell takes the stage with Jack The Whipper.</strong></p><p>This leaked America’s Got Talent audition features contestant, Jack The Whipper. Although we’re unable to see the beginning of audition banter, many will notice that Cowell hit his red buzzer before joining the act on stage. We’re curious to see how that happened on Tuesday night.</p><p>The beginning of the video features Jack The Whipper asking Cowell if he’d get into a squat position. Once he was in the position, the contestant placed his target (a straw) between the judges knees. Before Jack The Whipper began the act, Cowell is seen saying “I shouldn’t have done this.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Even though Cowell is clearly nervous, Heidi Klum and Sofia Vergara are in hysterics about the situation. Soon enough, Jack The Whipper quickly knocks the target out between Cowell’s knees. The judges automatic reaction is bleeped out, but he doesn’t seem to be in any type of pain. Both Klum and Vergara are seen travelling toward the stage at the end of the clip.</p><p>Reportedly, the contestant was just as nervous as Cowell during his audition. He recently told <a href=#>The Sun UK</a> that he was horrified at the thought of messing up. He stated: “I wasn’t sure what would happen if I hit Simon with a whip.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-jack-the-whipper>Who is Jack The Whipper?</h2><p>Jack The Whipper aka Jack Lepiarz is a 34 year old from Boston, Massachusetts. He’s a professional circus performer, radio anchor, and world record holder. At the time of his audition he has more than 238,000 followers on Instagram and 1.9 million followers on TikTok. His username on the social media platforms are jacqueszewhipper. His videos feature whip cracking, accordion, comedy, and more.</p><p>Similar to last week’s whipcracker Adam Winrich, Jack holds a <a href=#>Guinness World Record</a> of his own. On September 6 2020, he achieved the record of the most bullwhip cracks in a minute in Somerville, Massachusetts. The current record is 298 bullwhips, his previous (2016) record was 289.</p><p>There isn’t much information on his circus origins ingrained within his website. We only know that he began performing onstage before he knew how to tie his shoes. We hope to hear more of his origin story during his <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> audition on Tuesday, July 19.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1395201138-1.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Winner Carrie Underwood’s Best Songs, Ranked" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZKCdpKh6uLTIqaeenF2eu264xJqinpxdlrS1ecCum6KsmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
