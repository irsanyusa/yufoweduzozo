She came to us with tattered ears and a potentially life-threatening infection in her uterus that has since been healed. She’s clearly been through so much trauma that we can’t begin to imagine, but she’s now safe with us at The Gentle Barn. From what we’ve been told, it’s believed she was purchased originally from a breeder by an influencer. People often buy “mini pigs” or “teacup pigs” for clout online, believing they will stay small. When they inevitably grow very large and have many unexpected needs, they’re sadly discarded. While we don’t know everything she’s been through in her past, we know her life is now filled with friends, nutritious foods, the highest quality care, and so much love. <a title=pigrescue href=# rel=noopener>#pigrescue</a> <a title=animalrescuestory href=# rel=noopener>#animalrescuestory</a> <a title=abandonedanimals href=# rel=noopener>#abandonedanimals</a> <a title=pigsoftiktok href=# rel=noopener>#pigsoftiktok</a> <a title=farmanimalrescue href=# rel=noopener>#farmanimalrescue</a> <a title=thegentlebarn href=# rel=noopener>#thegentlebarn</a> <a title="♬ Where is My Mind? - Piano Version - The Blue Notes" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Where is My Mind? – Piano Version – The Blue Notes</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-logan-paul-s-pet-pig-pearl-found-abandoned-in-a-field>Logan Paul’s Pet Pig Pearl Found Abandoned in a Field</h2><p>A farm animal sanctuary called the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gentle Barn</a> recently posted a TikTok video sharing that they received a call about a pig abandoned in a field. The organization said she “was found in a field with another pig who had passed away.”</p><p>The video states that Pearl is “lucky to still be alive.” It continues, “We were told she belonged to a famous YouTuber and was irresponsibly rehomed. All we know for sure is she ended up abandoned and scared with mangled ears and a broken heart.”</p><p>In the video’s caption, the sanctuary shared that Pearl also had “a potentially life-threatening infection in her uterus that has since been healed.” They emphasized that Pearl’s “life is now filled with friends, nutritious foods, the highest quality care, and so much love.”</p><p>In February 2020, Paul posted on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> about how much Pearl had grown since he got her, writing that he “was told she was a mini pig.” As the Gentle Barn wrote on TikTok, people often buy so-called “mini pigs” thinking they’ll stay small.

He wrote that Pearl lived with him in Encino for two years and was “treated like the princess she is.” However, when he moved to Puerto Rico in April 2020, Paul writes that Pearl was “rehomed at a horse ranch in Santa Clarita.”</p><p>“From my understanding, she lived fruitfully there for about 10 months until that homeowner moved, as well,” Paul wrote. “Pearl was then rehomed to the farmer across the street with the promise of care. I’ve heard that he called your organization to pick her up.”</p><p>Paul wrote that it was “shocking and heartbreaking to hear the state she was found in.” He added that he “thought she was at a good home” and offered to “contribute to her care again.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_AmandaKloots_AlanBersten_Eric-McCandlessABC-via-Getty-Images-220x150.jpg alt="Amanda Kloots Opens Up About Her Relationship With Alan Bersten" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>logan paul</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y6iemqZdpa62uNJmp56sXaW2qHnFqKynnF2Wr6K6w6ilnpxdnbJur8uaoKarXai1pnnWmqpmqpWdvK6xw2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
