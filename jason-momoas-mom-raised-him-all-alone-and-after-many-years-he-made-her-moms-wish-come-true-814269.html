They have a&nbsp;deep connection, and their <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> for each other is&nbsp;evident in&nbsp;their public appearances and social media posts. And one day, Momoa decided to&nbsp;surprise his mom in&nbsp;the sweetest way.</p><p><h2>Momoa shares a&nbsp;strong bond with his mom.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/829/f7a/82656c529dbe7e528d8f44b313.jpg><p>Jason Momoa, the fantastic actor we&nbsp;all love, was born in&nbsp;beautiful <a href=# title=Hawaii data-link=tag>Hawaii</a>. His parents are both incredibly talented artists. His mom, Coni, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;super-talented photographer, and his dad, Joseph, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;amazing painter. However, Jason was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>raised</a> in&nbsp;Iowa by&nbsp;his mom, Coni, who has profoundly impacted his life.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;heartwarming Carhartt short film called “Canvas of&nbsp;My&nbsp;Life,” the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i></a> shared his deep admiration for his mom. He&nbsp;fondly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>: “I&nbsp;was raised by&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong <strong>single mother</strong>. My&nbsp;mom’s an&nbsp;artist in&nbsp;every way. She’s a&nbsp;painter, a&nbsp;photographer. She’s a&nbsp;wanderer, always searching, always seeing. I&nbsp;guess you could say <strong>my&nbsp;mom gave me&nbsp;her eyes</strong>.”</p><h2>“<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Raised</a> by&nbsp;women.

After <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>separating</a> from Jason’s father and returning to&nbsp;her hometown, Coni faced the challenge of&nbsp;raising her son as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother.</p><p>She took on&nbsp;the incredible feat of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>working</a> three to&nbsp;four jobs just to&nbsp;ensure their needs were met while Jason was studying in&nbsp;high school. Jason remains deeply grateful for everything his mother, Coni, has done for him and lovingly refers to&nbsp;her as&nbsp;his superhero.</p><p>Jason expressed his profound love for his family touchingly by&nbsp;getting tattoos of&nbsp;their first names, each in&nbsp;their handwriting. These meaningful artworks are proudly displayed on&nbsp;his chest. While his mother and her family played a&nbsp;crucial role in&nbsp;raising him, Jason’s father also made efforts to&nbsp;be&nbsp;present in&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;the talented Hollywood star.</p><p><h2>Jason Momoa took his mom to&nbsp;meet Julia Roberts, creating a&nbsp;memorable moment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5df/8bc/4155065ba8b8822b3d7d87b372.jpg><p>Jason Momoa, 43, had an&nbsp;exciting encounter with the beloved actress <a href=# title="Julia Roberts" data-link=tag>Julia Roberts</a>, who is&nbsp;55&nbsp;years old.
