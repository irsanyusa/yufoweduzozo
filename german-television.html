The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">world’s first TV channel</a> Paul Nipkow started broadcasting on 22 March 1935. The milestones that followed shaped German television up to today:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>1948, the NWDR, Nordwestdeutsche Rundfunk,&nbsp; started broadcasting in the British zone, with other regional networks following the example in other areas of Germany.&nbsp;</li><li>1954, the ARD was the first to introduce a regular schedule.&nbsp;</li><li>1963, the ZDF directed its program for the first time to all of Germany.&nbsp;</li><li>1967 saw the beginning of color TV in Germany.&nbsp;</li><li>1984, advertisement-funded RTL and SAT 1 opened the market for many more commercial channels to follow.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The eight most popular German TV channels</h2><p>German public television is the root of German television, but it wouldn’t be complete without the most popular commercial channels. Both are free-to-air. While the commercial channels fund themselves through advertisement, the public channels rely on a broadcasting fee. So don’t forget to obtain your TV (and radio) license <a href=#>GEZ</a>, when you <a href=#>register your address in Germany</a>. And always remember to pay in time!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-ARD->1. ARD&nbsp;</h2><p>The ARD is a consortium of regional German public broadcasters also known as Das Erste (the First). The daily news program Tagesschau and the Tagesthemen on the weekend make it one of the most important German news channels. The crime series Tatort, broadcasted since the 70s, is also one of the best <a href=#>series to learn German</a>. The same goes for the German football team’s games.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-ZDF->2. ZDF&nbsp;</h2><p>The centrally organized ZDF was the first competitor of the ARD and is therefore also known as Das Zweite (the Second). The news program Heute addresses a slightly younger audience than the news on ARD and positions ZDF among the favorite German news channels. A good place to learn about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German political landscape</a>. No German television experience is complete without the traditional entertainment show Wetten, dass…?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-WDR->3. WDR&nbsp;</h2><p>The WDR, Westdeutscher Rundfunk, is one of the biggest of the many regional German TV channels. Other examples are the NDR, MDR, SWR, SR and Radio Bremen. WDR contributes a great deal to the programming of ARD and is known for classics like the Rockpalast for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">music fans</a> or the Sendung mit der Maus for children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-ARTE->4. ARTE&nbsp;</h2><p>The public European culture channel ARTE promotes understanding among Europeans through high-quality, creative content in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French </a>and German.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-KiKA>5. KiKA</h2><p>The children’s channel operated by ARD and ZDF educates and entertains children with shows like KiKANiNCHEN for the little ones or Schloss Einstein for teens.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-RTL>6. RTL</h2><p>The popularity of RTL and its channel VOX lies in a mix of reality TV such as the dating show Bauer sucht Frau, popular American series and Formula 1.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-SAT-1>7. SAT 1</h2><p>SAT 1 is another commercial channel with American as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German movies and series</a> and the Bundesliga.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8.-PRO-7>8. PRO 7</h2><p>With American TV series such as The Simpsons, the late-night show TV Total, the celebrity show TAFF and the science show Galileo, the commercial channel is all about entertainment.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-does-German-television-cost?>What does German television cost?</h2><p>The public and commercial channels are free-to-air and available via satellite or cable. You can also get TV together with home telephone and internet from one provider, in which case the price depends on your subscription. Because of the strong position of the free German TV channels, pay-TV options are limited to mainly SKY, RTL, Disney and MTV.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, all the international streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ are available in Germany, too. Most channels will let you catch up with a program through their website, for example, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ZDF Mediathek</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>German TV Channels</h2><p>German public television such as ARD, ZDF, WDR, ARTE or KiKA and German commercial TV channels such as RTL, SAT 1 and PRO 7 will not disappoint, whether you want to watch the news, a blockbuster or the latest sports event. Better even, they offer a free opportunity to practice the German language and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">advance to the next level</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sandra-1-e1679306137443.jpg><h2>Sandra Köktas</h2><p>Sandra lives in Istanbul, together with her kids, cat and dog.
