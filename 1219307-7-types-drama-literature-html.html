Usually, drama is performed rather than read. Discover more below.</p><h2>Types of drama: all you need to know</h2><p class=align-left>Dramas are normally called plays. Their creators are known as dramatists or playwrights. They have been performed since the days of Aristotle, i.e. around 335 BCE.</p><h3>What is drama in English literature?</h3><p class=align-left>The word drama was derived from the Greek words δρᾶμα and δράω. The <a href=#>first means</a> an act or play, while the latter means to act or take action.</p><p class=align-left>In literature, drama encompasses the portrayal of fictional or non-fictional events through the performance of written dialogue. Through it, stories and events are brought to life by actors on a stage.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6f82ff43cbbcda74.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Artists fight AI programs that copy their styles</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Aristotle, a famous Greek philosopher, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">defined it</a> as a poetic composition acted in front of audiences in a&nbsp;theatre. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Its purpose</a> is to arouse the audience's feelings and purge these emotions, thus making people stronger emotionally. <a href=#>It combines</a> performance, dance, <a href=#>music</a>, and props.</p><h2>Types of drama in literature</h2><p class=align-left>Below is an exploration of the various forms of drama in literature. The elements of drama are scenery and costume, musical score, libretto, characterisation, plot, and thought content. These elements are seen in all types.</p><h3>1. Comedy</h3><p class=align-left>Comedy is one of the most popular forms of drama in literature. It aims to make the audience laugh.</p><p class=align-left>Its tone is light, and it almost always has a happy ending. The form <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started with Aristotle </a>in ancient Greece in the 4th century BCE.</p><p class=align-left>Examples of drama are <i>Noises Off </i>by Michael Frayn and <i>The Simpsons. </i>The latter had a 26-year run. Most characters on the show had hilarious characters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b7b2d16404bdde9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Online popularity isn't political currency & 5 other lessons celebrities should learn from 2023 elections</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6f82ff43cbbcda74.jpg><h3>2. Tragedy</h3><p class=align-left>In tragedy, the protagonist or hero is brought down by his/her flaws. Murders, pain, deaths, and insanity are among the most common ideas in tragedies. In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tragic stories</a>, the main character usually has some weakness or defect that causes their downfall.</p><p class=align-left>The<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> aim of tragedy</a> is to release of certain emotions from the audience. It arouses sensations of pity and fear. Actors leave the theatre with an understanding of the ways of gods and men.</p><p class=align-left>The audience's catharsis comes through witnessing disastrous and moving changes in the fortunes of the protagonist. Examples are <i>Hamlet, Oedipus Rex, Romeo and Juliet</i>, and <i>Julius Caesar</i>.</p><h3>3. Tragicomedy</h3><p class=align-left>Tragicomedy <a href=#>combines the features</a> of tragedy and comedy, e.g., a play <a href=#>can</a> have a sad plot and a happy ending or be serious, with some elements of humour emerging throughout the play.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/75479ec5f5cb69d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 iconic 90s cartoons that will instantly trigger your nostalgia</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unlike comedy and tragedy, tragicomedy emerged a bit later, in the times of the Roman Empire. Roman dramatist Plautus was the first person to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">write a tragicomedy</a>.</p><p class=align-left>In his play <i>Amphitryon,</i> he used the lightheartedness of comedy but chose gods and kings as the main characters. He noted that every human being's life features some tragedy and comedy. An example is <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>.</p><h3>4. Melodrama</h3><p class=align-left>Melodrama is a kind of drama in which everything is hyperbolised. Hyperbole is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech.</p><p class=align-left>Usually, themes depicted in melodramas are simple and without any unpredictable plot twists. There are quite a lot of stereotypes in such dramas.</p><p class=align-left>The primary goal of a melodrama is to awaken feelings in the audience. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Melodramas are</a> mostly love stories with charming heroes, scary villains, and beautiful heroines.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ceb9cd5cbafdddf4.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 best mutant movies of all time (not including X-Men)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Melodrama originated much later than comedy, tragedy, and tragicomedy. It first appeared in France at the end of the 18th century. Examples are <i>All That Heaven Allows</i> by Douglas Sirk and <i>Now Voyager</i> by Olive Higgins Prouty.</p><h3>5. Farce</h3><p class=align-left>Farce is a form of drama that uses absurd forms of comedy, also known as dark humour. Its humour depends more on the character's physical appearance and silly <a href=#>jokes</a> rather than the storyline.</p><p class=align-left>Farce differs from a comedy in that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the plot</a> is primarily illogical, and the occurring events are impossible. Examples are <i>Airplane! </i>by Jim Abrahams and <i>Waiting for Godot </i>by Samuel Beckett.</p><h3>6. Opera</h3><p class=align-left>Opera is a staged drama entirely <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">set to music</a>. It is made up of vocal pieces with instrumental accompaniment and usually with orchestral overtures and interludes.</p><p class=align-left>In some operas, the music is continuous throughout an act. In others, it is broken up into discrete pieces separated by spoken dialogue or recitative. Examples are<i> La traviata</i> by Verdi, <i>Carmen</i> by Bizet, and <i>Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute)</i> by Mozart.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/06498362270345dd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Most famous trios in popular culture: from history to fiction</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b7b2d16404bdde9.jpg><h3>7. Musical</h3><p class=align-left>Musicals <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">combine songs</a>, spoken dialogue, dance, and acting. It is pretty easy to confuse them with operas. In an opera, the lines are sung, but a musical employs dialogues infused with music performances. Examples are <i>The Sound of Music</i> and <i>My Fair Lady</i>.</p><h2>What are the elements of drama?</h2><p class=align-left>The elements of drama are plot, musical score, scenery and costume, libretto, thought content, and characterisation.</p><h3>What are the different types of costume in drama?</h3><p class=align-left>The main <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">types of costumes</a> in theatre are historical, fantastical, dance, and modern.</p><h3>How many types of drama are there?</h3><p class=align-left>There are seven forms of drama, as explored above.</p><p class=align-left>Understanding the different types of drama is important for all lovers of literature, theatre, and film productions. Drama started as a form of entertainment with the ancient Greeks and has evolved and split into different forms and types.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5f73d23de849d880.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>12 books like Harry Potter for those who don't want the magic to end</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Background of the study in research: guide on how to write one</a></p><p class=align-left>Legit.ng recently published a guide on how to write the<a href=#>background of a study</a> in research.
